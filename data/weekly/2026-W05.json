      "title": "MMFineReason: Closing the Multimodal Reasoning Gap via Open Data-Centric Methods",
      "abstract": "Recent advances in Vision Language Models (VLMs) have driven significant progress in visual reasoning. However, open-source VLMs still lag behind proprietary systems, largely due to the lack of high-quality reasoning data. Existing datasets offer limited coverage of challenging domains such as STEM diagrams and visual puzzles, and lack consistent, long-form Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations essential for eliciting strong reasoning capabilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce MMFineReason, a large-scale multimodal reasoning dataset comprising 1.8M samples and 5.1B solution tokens, featuring high-quality reasoning annotations distilled from Qwen3-VL-235B-A22B-Thinking. The dataset is established via a systematic three-stage pipeline: (1) large-scale data collection and standardization, (2) CoT rationale generation, and (3) comprehensive selection based on reasoning quality and difficulty awareness. The resulting dataset spans STEM problems, visual puzzles, games, and complex diagrams, with each sample annotated with visually grounded reasoning traces. We fine-tune Qwen3-VL-Instruct on MMFineReason to develop MMFineReason-2B/4B/8B versions. Our models establish new state-of-the-art results for their size class. Notably, MMFineReason-4B succesfully surpasses Qwen3-VL-8B-Thinking, and MMFineReason-8B even outperforms Qwen3-VL-30B-A3B-Thinking while approaching Qwen3-VL-32B-Thinking, demonstrating remarkable parameter efficiency. Crucially, we uncover a \"less is more\" phenomenon via our difficulty-aware filtering strategy: a subset of just 7% (123K samples) achieves performance comparable to the full dataset. Notably, we reveal a synergistic effect where reasoning-oriented data composition simultaneously boosts general capabilities.",

(2) Inherent efficiency: at compression ratio R=2, attention computation reduces by R²× and KV cache by R×, achieving prefill speedups up to 175% and decoding speedups up to 117%.

      "abstract": "The evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) into autonomous agents necessitates the management of extensive, dynamic contexts. Current benchmarks, however, remain largely static, relying on passive retrieval tasks that fail to simulate the complexities of agent-environment interaction, such as non-linear reasoning and iterative feedback. To address this, we introduce \\textbf{AgentLongBench}, which evaluates agents through simulated environment rollouts based on Lateral Thinking Puzzles. This framework generates rigorous interaction trajectories across knowledge-intensive and knowledge-free scenarios. Experiments with state-of-the-art models and memory systems (32K to 4M tokens) expose a critical weakness: while adept at static retrieval, agents struggle with the dynamic information synthesis essential for workflows. Our analysis indicates that this degradation is driven by the minimum number of tokens required to resolve a query. This factor explains why the high information density inherent in massive tool responses poses a significantly greater challenge than the memory fragmentation typical of long-turn dialogues.

Token-level Filtering vs Document-level Filtering (Figure 3) Token filtering Pareto-dominates document filtering : Can achieve equal reduction in undesired capabilities (equal medical loss) at lower cost to desired capabilities (lower biology loss) More precise filtering preserves beneficial content better 2. Scaling Effects (Figures 1, 4, 5, 6) Filtering gets more effective with scale : 1.8B parameter models see 7,000× compute slowdown on medical domain Document filtering: ~30× slowdown Token removal: >7,000× slowdown Multiple choice evaluation : Models score near chance on MedMCQA and MedQA-USMLE (medical), but maintain performance on retain domains Free response : Token filtering reduces medical answer correctness up to 20×, relevance/coherence 3× compared to baseline 3. Robustness to Attacks (Figure 7) 10× more robust than unlearning against adversarial finetuning attacks for 1.8B models State-of-the-art unlearning (RMU) requires 13× fewer tokens to recover capabilities compared to token removal 4. Alignment Compatibility (Figures 8, 9) Models can still be aligned on forget domain : Token-level filtering makes refusal training easier (2× better refusal generalization) Document filtering struggles with alignment generalization Linear probes show models can distinguish forget vs. retain tokens despite filtering 5. Classifier Training (Table 1, Figure 11) Small, task-specific models outperform large general ones : 224M parameter biLM achieves 0.894 F1 on test set Outperforms 395M ModernBERT-large (0.794 F1) Domain-specific pretraining improves performance 6. Label Quality Tolerance (Figures 12, 13, 14, 15) Robust to imperfect labels : Aggressive filtering with sufficient compute can overcome label noise Token-level classifiers generalize from weak labels better than document-level Can trade precision for recall to maintain effectiveness",

      "abstract": "While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in language-based agentic tasks, their applicability to unseen, nonlinguistic environments (e.g., symbolic or spatial tasks) remains limited. Previous work attributes this performance gap to the mismatch between the pretraining distribution and the testing distribution. In this work, we demonstrate the primary bottleneck is the prohibitive cost of exploration: mastering these tasks requires extensive trial-and-error, which is computationally unsustainable for parameter-heavy LLMs operating in a high dimensional semantic space. To address this, we propose SCOUT (Sub-Scale Collaboration On Unseen Tasks), a novel framework that decouples exploration from exploitation. We employ lightweight \"scouts\" (e.g., small MLPs) to probe environmental dynamics at a speed and scale far exceeding LLMs. The collected trajectories are utilized to bootstrap the LLM via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), followed by multi-turn Reinforcement Learning (RL) to activate its latent world knowledge. Empirically, SCOUT enables a Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct model to achieve an average score of 0.86, significantly outperforming proprietary models, including Gemini-2.5-Pro (0.60), while saving about 60% GPU hours consumption.",

However, token-space similarity is often a weak proxy for semantic or structural behavior. We propose GANPO, a plug-and-play regularizer that introduces latent-space adversarial regularization, aligning the latent representation distributions of a policy and a reference model via a principled GAN-style divergence. We find consistent performance improvements. GANPO yields consistent gains across model architectures when integrated into OPO-style methods on AlpacaEval. We also find that structure is preserved. The adversarial objective acts as a geometry-preserving regularizer. Unlike DPO, which often degrades at high sampling temperatures (T ≥ 1.0), GANPO maintains structural coherence in high-entropy settings.

      "abstract": "What if RL isn’t teaching LLMs how to reason, but just sharpening what’s already there? Most recent progress in LLM reasoning comes from RL post-training (GRPO, verifiers, rewards). But there’s growing evidence that these gains may come less from learning new capabilities and more from reshaping the distribution of outputs. In our new work, we take that idea seriously. We show that: Reasoning trajectories already exist in base models What matters is how you sample, not how you retrain The global power distribution can be approximated autoregressively, without MCMC The result is a training-free, verifier-free inference-time method that: ⚡ Matches GRPO-style post-training ⏱ Is ~10× faster than MCMC-based power sampling 🧪 Requires no rewards, no finetuning, no verifier Conceptually, the key insight is simple: Power sampling ≈ low-temperature sampling × future-aware token scaling This lets us recover global reasoning behaviour token by token, without expensive trajectory-level inference.",

By rendering previous reasoning segments into compact visual representations, VTC-R1 replaces long textual contexts with significantly fewer vision tokens in a lightweight and model-free manner. Extensive experiments show that VTC-R1 consistently improves reasoning accuracy across multiple benchmarks while achieving up to 3.4x token compression and 2.7x end-to-end inference speedup. The results demonstrate that VTC-R1 provides an effective alternative representation for scalable long-context reasoning.

      "abstract": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) suffer from cross-modal hallucinations, where one modality inappropriately influences generation about another, leading to fabricated output. This exposes a more fundamental deficiency in modality-interaction control. To address this, we propose Modality-Adaptive Decoding (MAD), a training-free method that adaptively weights modality-specific decoding branches based on task requirements. MAD leverages the model's inherent ability to self-assess modality relevance by querying which modalities are needed for each task. The extracted modality probabilities are then used to adaptively weight contrastive decoding branches, enabling the model to focus on relevant information while suppressing cross-modal interference. Extensive experiments on CMM and AVHBench demonstrate that MAD significantly reduces cross-modal hallucinations across multiple audio-visual language models (7.8% and 2.0% improvements for VideoLLaMA2-AV, 8.7% and 4.7% improvements for Qwen2.5-Omni). Our approach demonstrates that explicit modality awareness through self-assessment is crucial for robust multimodal reasoning, offering a principled extension to existing contrastive decoding methods.",

      "abstract": "The ability of visuomotor policies to generalize across tasks and environments critically depends on the structure of the underlying visual representations. While most state-of-the-art robot policies rely on either global or dense features from pre-trained vision models, these approaches often entangle task-relevant and irrelevant signals, limiting their robustness to visual distribution shifts. In this paper, we investigate Slot-based Object-Centric Representations (SOCRs) as a structured alternative that decomposes scenes into a finite set of object-like entities. We present the first large-scale, systematic comparison of global, dense, and object-centric representations across diverse simulated (METAWORLD, LIBERO) and real-world robotic manipulation tasks. Our results show that SOCRs enable superior policy performance and significantly improve generalization under shifts in lighting, texture, and clutter— even without task-specific tuning. We further demonstrate that pretraining SOCRs on robotic video datasets amplifies these benefits. Our findings highlight the importance of structured visual abstraction in robotic perception and suggest that SOCRs offer a promising pathway toward more robust and generaliz- able manipulation policies.",

      "abstract": "Our analysis revealed a phenomenon we term Manifold Realignment. RLVR is a Trajectory Optimizer : We found that RLVR irreversibly reorganizes the local geometry of the latent manifold but largely preserves the global manifold geometry (the overall map of knowledge) and the linear readout of base models. Coordinate basis will alter substantially and reversibly only under prolonged RLVR. Contrastive Learning acts as an Equalizer : When we fine-tune these models to embedding models, the contrastive loss forces the base and reasoning models to align strongly again. The Takeaway for Practitioners: Our results suggest that the \"reasoning\" capability in current models is a learned policy for navigating the latent manifold , rather than a fundamental restructuring of the knowledge map itself. As latent-space-centric paradigms such as World Models and JEPA gain prominence, our findings point to a practical trade-off: RLVR tends to preserve the base model’s representational backbone (which may help retain broad generalization), yet on its own is unlikely to fundamentally improve the underlying global organization of the latent manifold. If RLVR’s distinctive footprint is local geometry reorganization under global geometry stability, then similar behavior might be achievable via SFT augmented with geometry- and basis-aware regularization .",

In this work, we delve into the inherent spectral characteristics of dLLMs and present the first frequency-domain analysis showing that low-frequency components in hidden states primarily encode global structural information and long-range dependencies, while high-frequency components are responsible for characterizing local details. Based on this observation, we propose FourierSampler, which leverages a frequency-domain sliding window mechanism to dynamically guide the model to achieve a \"structure-to-detail\" generation. FourierSampler outperforms other inference enhancement strategies on LLADA and SDAR, achieving relative improvements of 20.4% on LLaDA1.5-8B and 16.0% on LLaDA-8B-Instruct.

      "title": "DreamActor-M2: Universal Character Image Animation via Spatiotemporal In-Context Learning",
      "abstract": "Character image animation aims to synthesize high-fidelity videos by transferring motion from a driving sequence to a static reference image. Despite recent advancements, existing methods suffer from two fundamental challenges: (1) suboptimal motion injection strategies that lead to a trade-off between identity preservation and motion consistency, manifesting as a \"see-saw\", and (2) an over-reliance on explicit pose priors (e.g., skeletons), which inadequately capture intricate dynamics and hinder generalization to arbitrary, non-humanoid characters. To address these challenges, we present DreamActor-M2, a universal animation framework that reimagines motion conditioning as an in-context learning problem. Our approach follows a two-stage paradigm. First, we bridge the input modality gap by fusing reference appearance and motion cues into a unified latent space, enabling the model to jointly reason about spatial identity and temporal dynamics by leveraging the generative prior of foundational models. Second, we introduce a self-bootstrapped data synthesis pipeline that curates pseudo cross-identity training pairs, facilitating a seamless transition from pose-dependent control to direct, end-to-end RGB-driven animation. This strategy significantly enhances generalization across diverse characters and motion scenarios. To facilitate comprehensive evaluation, we further introduce AW Bench, a versatile benchmark encompassing a wide spectrum of characters types and motion scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DreamActor-M2 achieves state-of-the-art performance, delivering superior visual fidelity and robust cross-domain generalization.

This work is motivated by the high computational cost of traditional compile-and-run validation in automated test generation, especially when using large language models (LLMs) for code tasks. RM-RF is trained on a multilingual dataset across Java, Python, and Go that pairs code + test files with execution-derived labels, and various model families and tuning regimes (zero-shot, fine-tuned, PEFT/LoRA) achieve ~0.69 F1 on the three targets. Key contributions include: a scalable “run-free” reward model that reduces latency and infrastructure needs compared to execution-based evaluation, a curated dataset and methodology for comparative assessment of unit test quality signals, empirical analysis of RM-RF with different model sizes and fine-tuning strategies. This approach can provide rapid feedback for large-scale test generation and RL-based code optimization, bridging a gap between high-fidelity execution feedback and scalable automated unit test evaluation.",

      "abstract": "🧪 TAM-Eval: Evaluating LLMs for Automated Unit Test Maintenance What’s new: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely explored for unit test generation , but real-world test suite maintenance — like creating, updating, and repairing tests as code evolves — hasn’t been systematically evaluated. This paper introduces TAM-Eval , the benchmark and evaluation framework that targets exactly these maintenance tasks in realistic software contexts. Core contributions: 🔹 Benchmark and framework: TAM-Eval evaluates LLMs on three maintenance scenarios — creation , repair , and updating of test suites — at the test file level with actual context (not isolated function snippets). 🔹 Real-world dataset: The benchmark is built from 1,539 automatically extracted and validated scenarios from open-source projects in Python, Java, and Go. 🔹 Evaluation metrics: Instead of simple accuracy scores, the framework uses reference-free metrics reflecting real software quality: Test suite pass rate Code coverage change Mutation testing outcomes These align closer to developer goals in maintenance. 🔹 Empirical results: State-of-the-art LLMs show only limited improvements on realistic maintenance workflows — indicating that current models still struggle with practical test suite evolution. Why it matters: Automated testing and maintenance are essential for high-quality software. Most benchmarks have focused on test generation at function level; TAM-Eval shifts the focus to maintenance workflows developers actually deal with , providing a new community standard for evaluating LLMs in software engineering contexts. Open science: The TAM-Eval code and dataset are fully open-source, enabling future research and direct integration into evaluation pipelines.",

      "abstract": "🚀 New Research Alert! 🧠✨ We’re excited to share our latest work: Deep Search with Hierarchical Meta-Cognitive Monitoring Inspired by Cognitive Neuroscience 🔍 What’s the key idea? Deep search agents powered by LLMs excel at multi-step reasoning and retrieval—but they often fail silently when small errors accumulate under uncertainty. Drawing direct inspiration from human cognitive neuroscience , we propose a hierarchical meta-cognitive monitoring framework that mirrors how humans detect anomalies, reflect on mistakes, and adapt their behavior during complex problem solving. 🧠 Neuroscience-inspired design Human metacognition is not monolithic: it combines fast, automatic error signals with slower, experience-driven reflection . We translate this principle into deep search agents via two complementary monitors: 🧩 Our approach introduces two complementary monitors: ⚡ Fast Consistency Monitor Inspired by rapid neural mechanisms for conflict and surprise detection (e.g., early mismatch and uncertainty signals), this module performs lightweight, always-on checks to detect misalignment between external evidence and internal reasoning confidence . 🐢 Slow Experience-Driven Monitor Inspired by higher-order reflective processes and memory-based control in the human brain, this module is selectively activated . It leverages experience from past trajectories to guide deliberate correction and strategic adjustment. 📈 Why does this matter? By embedding neuroscience-inspired meta-cognitive monitoring directly into the ReAct loop of a Deep Search Agent, our framework: Enhances robustness and reliability in long-horizon reasoning Enables early detection and correction of cascading errors Establishes a tighter conceptual bridge between human metacognition and agentic AI system design 🧪 Results Experiments across multiple deep search benchmarks and backbone models demonstrate consistent improvements in both performance and robustness , validating the effectiveness of this cognitively grounded design.",

      "abstract": "RLHF is central to aligning LLMs with human preferences, but it often suffers from reward overoptimization: the policy learns to game the reward model instead of truly following human intent. A key reason? Distribution shift—the policy keeps changing, while the reward model stays static. R2M (Real-Time Aligned Reward Model) tackles this head-on. Instead of relying only on fixed semantic features, R2M feeds on the policy’s evolving hidden states, aligning the reward model in real time with the policy’s trajectory during RL. 🔑 Takeaway: Reward models shouldn’t be passive judges. They should co-evolve with the policy.",

      "abstract": "End-to-end autonomous driving increasingly leverages self-supervised video pretraining to learn transferable planning representations. However, pretraining video world models for scene understanding has so far brought only limited improvements. This limitation is compounded by the inherent ambiguity of driving: each scene typically provides only a single human trajectory, making it difficult to learn multimodal behaviors. In this work, we propose Drive-JEPA, a framework that integrates Video Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (V-JEPA) with multimodal trajectory distillation for end-to-end driving. First, we adapt V-JEPA for end-to-end driving, pretraining a ViT encoder on large-scale driving videos to produce predictive representations aligned with trajectory planning. Second, we introduce a proposal-centric planner that distills diverse simulator-generated trajectories alongside human trajectories, with a momentum-aware selection mechanism to promote stable and safe behavior. When evaluated on NAVSIM, the V-JEPA representation combined with a simple transformer-based decoder outperforms prior methods by 3 PDMS in the perception-free setting. The complete Drive-JEPA framework achieves 93.3 PDMS on v1 and 87.8 EPDMS on v2, setting a new state-of-the-art.",

We propose ExpAlign, a theoretically grounded vision-language alignment framework built on a principled multiple instance learning formulation. ExpAlign introduces an Expectation Alignment Head that performs attentionbased soft MIL pooling over token-region similarities, enabling implicit token and instance selection without additional annotations. To further stabilize alignment learning, we develop an energy-based multi-scale consistency regularization scheme, including a Top-K multi-positive contrastive objective and a Geometry-Aware Consistency Objective derived from a Lagrangianconstrained free-energy minimization. Extensive experiments show that ExpAlign consistently improves open-vocabulary detection and zero-shot instance segmentation, particularly on long-tail categories. Most notably, it achieves 36.2 APron the LVIS minival split, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods at comparable model scale, while remaining lightweight and inference efficient.",

That hope is getting expensive. If the “AGI won’t happen from brute-force scaling” camp is even partly right, then the bottleneck is clear: value per gradient step. So we asked a practical question: Can a small amount of verified goal information steer the massive unlabeled pretraining phase—without turning pretraining into supervised finetuning?

      "abstract": "We introduce KAPSO, a modular framework for autonomous program synthesis and optimization. Given a natural language goal and an evaluation method, KAPSO iteratively performs ideation, code synthesis and editing, execution, evaluation, and learning to improve a runnable artifact toward measurable objectives. Rather than treating synthesis as the endpoint, KAPSO uses synthesis as an operator within a long-horizon optimization loop, where progress is defined by evaluator outcomes. KAPSO targets long-horizon failures common in coding agents, including lost experimental state, brittle debugging, and weak reuse of domain expertise, by integrating three tightly coupled components. First, a git-native experimentation engine isolates each attempt as a branch, producing reproducible artifacts and preserving provenance across iterations. Second, a knowledge system ingests heterogeneous sources, including repositories, internal playbooks, and curated external resources such as documentation, scientific papers, and web search results, and organizes them into a structured representation that supports retrieval over workflows, implementations, and environment constraints. Third, a cognitive memory layer coordinates retrieval and maintains an episodic store of reusable lessons distilled from experiment traces (run logs, diffs, and evaluator feedback), reducing repeated error modes and accelerating convergence. We evaluated KAPSO on MLE-Bench (Kaggle-style ML competitions) and ALE-Bench (AtCoder heuristic optimization), and report end-to-end performance.
