We leverage these emergent abstractions to introduce Internal RL, a method that reinforces semantically meaningful actions inside the residual stream of a sequence model. This enables solving sparse-reward hierarchical tasks that remain intractable for standard token-level approaches like GRPO.",

      "abstract": "Existing video generation models struggle to maintain long-term spatial and temporal consistency due to the dense, high-dimensional nature of video signals. To overcome this limitation, we propose Spatia, a spatial memory-aware video generation framework that explicitly preserves a 3D scene point cloud as persistent spatial memory. Spatia iteratively generates video clips conditioned on this spatial memory and continuously updates it through visual SLAM. This dynamic-static disentanglement design enhances spatial consistency throughout the generation process while preserving the model's ability to produce realistic dynamic entities. Furthermore, Spatia enables applications such as: Explicit Camera Control 3D-Aware Interactive Editing Long-horizon Scene Exploration",

      "abstract": "We extend a cognitive science-inspired episode annotation framework to an automatic, scalable, sentence-level representation that supports large-scale analysis of reasoning traces and conduct a systematic study of reasoning dynamics across a diverse set of LLMs. Moreover, we demonstrate the practical utility of episode-level representations through downstream case studies on correctness and efficiency, illustrating how reasoning dynamics can be analyzed beyond outcome-based metrics. Key Findings: When reasoning traces are analyzed at the episode level, a functional progression from abstract reasoning to concrete execution, and finally to evaluative control, consistently emerges. Episodes associated with analysis and exploration use more abstract, conceptual language and decrease steadily as reasoning progresses, while execution-oriented episodes dominate the middle of the trace through sustained concrete operations. In contrast, verification-related episodes are characterized by evaluative and meta-level language and increase toward the end of the reasoning process. Comparing reasoning and non-reasoning models, the difference is not merely how many tokens they generate, but how reasoning is structured. Non-reasoning models allocate most of their response trace to execution , with episode transitions largely following a feed-forward pattern toward implementation. In contrast, reasoning models distribute effort across analysis, exploration, execution, and verification, and exhibit frequent iterative Explore-Monitor/Verify loops. Through our correctness-oriented case study, we find that exploration reflects uncertainty and serves as a critical branching point : correct solutions more often route exploration into monitoring or re-analysis, whereas incorrect solutions tend to continue execution or terminate prematurely after exploration. Through our efficiency-oriented case study, we find that different efficient reasoning methods selectively suppress evaluation-oriented episodes and feedback loops, leading to varying degrees of divergence from the reasoning patterns of the base model. Episode-level analysis thus reveals which episodes can be removed to gain efficiency, beyond token-level pruning.",

      "title": "VA-π: Variational Policy Alignment for Pixel-Aware Autoregressive Generation",
      "abstract": "Autoregressive (AR) visual generation relies on tokenizers to map images to and from discrete sequences. However, tokenizers are trained to reconstruct clean images from ground-truth tokens, while AR generators are optimized only for token likelihood. This misalignment leads to generated token sequences that may decode into low-quality images, without direct supervision from the pixel space. We propose VA-, a lightweight post-training framework that directly optimizes AR models with a principled pixel-space objective. VA- formulates the generator-tokenizer alignment as a variational optimization, deriving an evidence lower bound (ELBO) that unifies pixel reconstruction and autoregressive modeling. To optimize under the discrete token space, VA- introduces a reinforcement-based alignment strategy that treats the AR generator as a policy, uses pixel-space reconstruction quality as its intrinsic reward. The reward is measured by how well the predicted token sequences can reconstruct the original image under teacher forcing, giving the model direct pixel-level guidance without expensive free-running sampling. The regularization term of the ELBO serves as a natural regularizer, maintaining distributional consistency of tokens. VA- enables rapid adaptation of existing AR generators, without neither tokenizer retraining nor external reward models. With only 1% ImageNet-1K data and 25 minutes of tuning, it reduces FID from 14.36 to 7.65 and improves IS from 86.55 to 116.70 on LlamaGen-XXL, while also yielding notable gains in the text-to-image task on GenEval for both visual generation model (LlamaGen: from 0.306 to 0.339) and unified multi-modal model (Janus-Pro: from 0.725 to 0.744)",

      "abstract": "🔆 Overview We argue that presentation design is inherently subjective. Users have different preferences in terms of narrative structure, emphasis, conciseness, aesthetic choices, etc. So in this work, we ask: Can we better model such diverse user preferences for personalized paper-to-slides generation? We make the following contributions: Task: We introduce and properly define a new task that conditions paper-to-slide generation on user-specified preferences. System: We propose a human behavior-inspired agentic framework, SlideTailor, that progressively generates editable slides in a user-aligned manner. Evaluation: We construct a benchmark dataset that captures diverse user preferences, with meticulously designed interpretable metrics for robust evaluation. Open Source: We release the source code and data to the community. 💻 Github: https://github.com/nusnlp/SlideTailor 📜 ArXiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20292 🤗 HF datasets: https://huggingface.co/datasets/yyyang/SlideTailor-PSP-dataset",

In this paradigm, policies are updated using both positive and negative self-generated rollouts, which correspond to distinct sample polarities. In this paper, we provide a systematic investigation into how these sample polarities affect RLVR training dynamics and behaviors. We find that positive samples sharpen existing correct reasoning patterns, while negative samples encourage exploration of new reasoning paths. We further explore how adjusting the advantage values of positive and negative samples at both the sample level and the token level affects RLVR training. Based on these insights, we propose an Adaptive and Asymmetric token-level Advantage shaping method for Policy Optimization, namely A3PO, that more precisely allocates advantage signals to key tokens across different polarities. Experiments across five reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.",

      "abstract": "Real-time video generation via diffusion is essential for building general-purpose multimodal interactive AI systems. However, the simultaneous denoising of all video frames with bidirectional attention via an iterative process in diffusion models prevents real-time interaction. While existing distillation methods can make the model autoregressive and reduce sampling steps to mitigate this, they focus primarily on text-to-video generation, leaving the human-AI interaction unnatural and less efficient. This paper targets real-time interactive video diffusion conditioned on a multimodal context, including text, image, and audio, to bridge the gap. Given the observation that the leading on-policy distillation approach Self Forcing encounters challenges (visual artifacts like flickering, black frames, and quality degradation) with multimodal conditioning, we investigate an improved distillation recipe with emphasis on the quality of condition inputs as well as the initialization and schedule for the on-policy optimization. On benchmarks for multimodal-conditioned (audio, image, and text) avatar video generation including HDTF, AVSpeech, and CelebV-HQ, our distilled model matches the visual quality of the full-step, bidirectional baselines of similar or larger size with 20x less inference cost and latency. Further, we integrate our model with audio language models and long-form video inference technique Anchor-Heavy Identity Sinks to build LiveTalk, a real-time multimodal interactive avatar system. System-level evaluation on our curated multi-turn interaction benchmark shows LiveTalk outperforms state-of-the-art models (Sora2, Veo3) in multi-turn video coherence and content quality, while reducing response latency from 1 to 2 minutes to real-time generation, enabling seamless human-AI multimodal interaction.",

The framework comprises three core components: (1) a long-video generation framework integrating unified context compression with linear attention; (2) a real-time streaming acceleration strategy powered by bidirectional attention distillation and an enhanced text embedding scheme; (3) a text-controlled method for generating world events.

Instead of burdening verifiers with verbose, noisy interaction trajectories, agents learn to select minimal, decisive snapshot evidences from their tool interactions.

      "abstract": "Abstract Transparent objects remain notoriously hard for perception systems: refraction, reflection and transmission break the assumptions behind stereo, ToF and purely discriminative monocular depth, causing holes and temporally unstable estimates. Our key observation is that modern video diffusion models already synthesize convincing transparent phenomena, suggesting they have internalized the optical rules. We build TransPhy3D, a synthetic video corpus of transparent/reflective scenes: 11k sequences (1.32M frames) rendered with Blender/Cycles. Scenes are assembled from a curated bank of category-rich static assets and shape-rich procedural assets paired with glass/plastic/metal materials. We render RGB + depth + normals with physically based ray tracing and OptiX denoising. Starting from a large video diffusion model, we learn a video-to-video translator for depth (and normals) via lightweight LoRA adapters. During training we concatenate RGB and (noisy) depth latents in the DiT backbone and co-train on TransPhy3D and existing frame-wise synthetic datasets, yielding temporally consistent predictions for arbitrary-length input videos. The resulting model, DKT, achieves zero-shot SOTA on real and synthetic video benchmarks involving transparency: ClearPose, DREDS (CatKnown/CatNovel), and TransPhy3D-Test. It improves accuracy and temporal consistency over strong image/video baselines (e.g., Depth-Anything-v2, DepthCrafter), and a normal variant (DKT-Normal) sets the best video normal estimation results on ClearPose. A compact 1.3B version runs at ~0.17 s/frame (832×480). Integrated into a grasping stack, DKT’s depth boosts success rates across translucent, reflective and diffuse surfaces, outperforming prior estimators. Together, these results support a broader claim: “Diffusion knows transparency.” Generative video priors can be repurposed, efficiently and label-free, into robust, temporally coherent perception for challenging real-world manipulation.

We propose Stream-DiffVSR, a causally conditioned diffusion framework for efficient online VSR.

Stream-DiffVSR processes 720p frames in 0.328 seconds on an RTX4090 GPU and significantly outperforms prior diffusion-based methods. Compared with the online SOTA TMP, it boosts perceptual quality (LPIPS +0.095) while reducing latency by over 130x. Stream-DiffVSR achieves the lowest latency reported for diffusion-based VSR, reducing initial delay from over 4600 seconds to 0.328 seconds, thereby making it the first diffusion VSR method suitable for low-latency online deployment.

      "abstract": "🎯 SpotEdit: Edit Only What Needs to Be Edited Why regenerate the entire background just to add a scarf to the dog in your photo? This is a frustrating limitation facing many current AI image editing models. Existing methods typically perform a full regeneration of the entire image even for small changes. This not only wastes a massive amount of computing time but often causes distortion or loss of detail in the background—areas that didn't need to be touched in the first place. SpotEdit is here to solve this problem. We refuse to \"overhaul\" the entire image, sticking instead to a simple yet powerful principle: Edit only what needs to be edited . 🚀 What is SpotEdit? SpotEdit is a training-free universal framework designed specifically for Diffusion Transformer (DiT) models. It automatically identifies which regions require editing and which should remain untouched, eliminating the need for you to manually paint complex masks. ✨ The Core \"Magic\" Automated Detection (SpotSelector) Acting like a pair of \"sharp eyes,\" this mechanism uses perceptual similarity to automatically distinguish between stable backgrounds and regions that need to change. It intelligently skips heavy computation for the background, concentrating processing power strictly on the \"cutting edge\" where changes are actually happening. Seamless Fusion (SpotFusion) For the background that doesn't need changing, SpotEdit does not regenerate it; instead, it directly reuses feature information from the original image. Simultaneously, through a dynamic fusion mechanism, it ensures that newly generated objects (like that added scarf) blend perfectly with the original background's lighting and texture, creating a result with no visual inconsistencies. 💡 Why Choose SpotEdit? ⚡️ Blazing Fast : By skipping massive amounts of unnecessary background computation, inference speed is boosted by nearly 2× . 🖼️ Zero Background Loss : It achieves true \"local editing,\" perfectly preserving every detail of the original background, so you no longer have to worry about the background \"collapsing\" or distorting. 🛠️ Training-Free : A plug-and-play solution that directly enhances the editing experience of existing models. SpotEdit returns image editing to its essence—precise, efficient, and respectful of the original image. HomePage: https://biangbiang0321.github.io/SpotEdit.github.io",

      "abstract": "The text encoder is a critical component of text-to-image and text-to-video diffusion models, fundamentally determining the semantic fidelity of the generated content. However, its development has been hindered by two major challenges: the lack of an efficient evaluation framework that reliably predicts downstream generation performance, and the difficulty of effectively adapting pretrained language models for visual synthesis. To address these issues, we introduce GRAN-TED, a paradigm to Generate Robust, Aligned, and Nuanced Text Embeddings for Diffusion models. Our contribution is twofold. First, we propose TED-6K, a novel text-only benchmark that enables efficient and robust assessment of an encoder's representational quality without requiring costly end-to-end model training. We demonstrate that performance on TED-6K, standardized via a lightweight, unified adapter, strongly correlates with an encoder's effectiveness in downstream generation tasks. Notably, under our experimental setup, compared with training a diffusion model from scratch, evaluating with TED-6K is about \\textbf{750$\\times$ faster}. Second, guided by this validated framework, we develop a superior text encoder using a novel two-stage training paradigm. This process involves an initial fine-tuning stage on a Multimodal Large Language Model for better visual representation, followed by a layer-wise weighting method to extract more nuanced and potent text features. Our experiments show that the resulting GRAN-TED encoder not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on TED-6K but also leads to demonstrable performance gains in text-to-image and text-to-video generation.

      "abstract": "Project page: https://act2goal.github.io/ Abs: Specifying robotic manipulation tasks in a manner that is both expressive and precise remains a central challenge. While visual goals provide a compact and unambiguous task specification, existing goal-conditioned policies often struggle with long-horizon manipulation due to their reliance on single-step action prediction without explicit modeling of task progress. We propose Act2Goal, a general goal-conditioned manipulation policy that integrates a goal-conditioned visual world model with multi-scale temporal control. Given a current observation and a target visual goal, the world model generates a plausible sequence of intermediate visual states that captures long-horizon structure. To translate this visual plan into robust execution, we introduce Multi-Scale Temporal Hashing (MSTH), which decomposes the imagined trajectory into dense proximal frames for fine-grained closed-loop control and sparse distal frames that anchor global task consistency. The policy couples these representations with motor control through end-to-end cross-attention, enabling coherent long-horizon behavior while remaining reactive to local disturbances. Act2Goal achieves strong zero-shot generalization to novel objects, spatial layouts, and environments. We further enable reward-free online adaptation through hindsight goal relabeling with LoRA-based finetuning, allowing rapid autonomous improvement without external supervision. Real-robot experiments demonstrate that Act2Goal improves success rates from 30% to 90% on challenging out-of-distribution tasks within minutes of autonomous interaction, validating that goal-conditioned world models with multi-scale temporal control provide structured guidance necessary for robust long-horizon manipulation.",

      "abstract": "In this work, we introduce the Web World Model (WWM), a middle ground where world state and physics are implemented in ordinary web code to ensure logical consistency, while large language models generate context, narratives, and high-level decisions on top of this structured latent state. We build a suite of WWMs on a realistic web stack, including an infinite travel atlas grounded in real geography, fictional galaxy explorers, web-scale encyclopedic and narrative worlds, and simulation- and game-like environments. Across these systems, we identify practical design principles for WWMs: separating code-defined rules from model-driven imagination, representing latent state as typed web interfaces, and utilizing deterministic generation to achieve unlimited but structured exploration. Our results suggest that web stacks themselves can serve as a scalable substrate for world models, enabling controllable yet open-ended environments.

      "abstract": "Diffusion Language Models (dLLMs) have emerged as promising alternatives to Auto-Regressive (AR) models. While recent efforts have validated their pre-training potential and accelerated inference speeds, the post-training landscape for dLLMs remains underdeveloped. Existing methods suffer from computational inefficiency and objective mismatches between training and inference, severely limiting performance on complex reasoning tasks such as mathematics. To address this, we introduce DiRL, an efficient post-training framework that tightly integrates FlexAttention-accelerated blockwise training with LMDeploy-optimized inference. This architecture enables a streamlined online model update loop, facilitating efficient two-stage post-training (Supervised Fine-Tuning followed by Reinforcement Learning). Building on this framework, we propose DiPO, the first unbiased Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) implementation tailored for dLLMs. We validate our approach by training DiRL-8B-Instruct on high-quality math data. Our model achieves state-of-the-art math performance among dLLMs and surpasses comparable models in the Qwen2.5 series on several benchmarks.

      "abstract": "Existing Real-Time Object Detection (RTOD) methods commonly adopt YOLO-like architectures for their favorable trade-off between accuracy and speed. However, these models rely on static dense computation that applies uniform processing to all inputs, misallocating representational capacity and computational resources such as over-allocating on trivial scenes while under-serving complex ones. This mismatch results in both computational redundancy and suboptimal detection performance. To overcome this limitation, we propose YOLO-Master, a novel YOLO-like framework that introduces instance-conditional adaptive computation for RTOD. This is achieved through a Efficient Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (ES-MoE) block that dynamically allocates computational resources to each input according to its scene complexity. At its core, a lightweight dynamic routing network guides expert specialization during training through a diversity enhancing objective, encouraging complementary expertise among experts. Additionally, the routing network adaptively learns to activate only the most relevant experts, thereby improving detection performance while minimizing computational overhead during inference. Comprehensive experiments on five large-scale benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of YOLO-Master. On MS COCO, our model achieves 42.4% AP with 1.62ms latency, outperforming YOLOv13-N by +0.8% mAP and 17.8% faster inference. Notably, the gains are most pronounced on challenging dense scenes, while the model preserves efficiency on typical inputs and maintains real-time inference speed. Code will be available.",

While full browser interaction could unlock deeper capabilities, its fine-grained control and verbose page content returns introduce substantial complexity for ReAct-style function-calling agents. To bridge this gap, we propose Nested Browser-Use Learning (NestBrowse), which introduces a minimal and complete browser-action framework that decouples interaction control from page exploration through a nested structure. This design simplifies agentic reasoning while enabling effective deep-web information acquisition. Empirical results on challenging deep IS benchmarks demonstrate that NestBrowse offers clear benefits in practice. Further in-depth analyses underscore its efficiency and flexibility.",

To address these challenges, we propose ProGuard, a vision-language proactive guard that identifies and describes out-of-distribution (OOD) safety risks without the need for model adjustments required by traditional reactive approaches. We first construct a modality-balanced dataset of 87K samples, each annotated with both binary safety labels and risk categories under a hierarchical multimodal safety taxonomy, effectively mitigating modality bias and ensuring consistent moderation across text, image, and text-image inputs. Based on this dataset, we train our vision-language base model purely through reinforcement learning (RL) to achieve efficient and concise reasoning. To approximate proactive safety scenarios in a controlled setting, we further introduce an OOD safety category inference task and augment the RL objective with a synonym-bank-based similarity reward that encourages the model to generate concise descriptions for unseen unsafe categories. Experimental results show that ProGuard achieves performance comparable to closed-source large models on binary safety classification, substantially outperforms existing open-source guard models on unsafe content categorization. Most notably, ProGuard delivers a strong proactive moderation ability, improving OOD risk detection by 52.6% and OOD risk description by 64.8%.",

Unlike diffusion-based models that are non-causal and latency-heavy, or autoregressive methods that suffer from error accumulation and motion discontinuities, our approach supports efficient frame-by-frame synthesis while maintaining long-term visual and temporal coherence on consumer-grade hardware. Our method introduces three key innovations: Chunk-wise causal generation with hybrid memory : We preserve global identity by caching KV states of the reference image, while modeling local dynamics using sliding window attention for efficient temporal coherence. Temporal knot module : By overlapping adjacent video chunks and propagating spatio-temporal cues via image-to-video conditioning, we smooth transitions and reduce motion jitter at chunk boundaries. Global context running ahead : During inference, we dynamically update the temporal coordinate of the reference frame to keep its semantic context ahead of the current generation step, enabling stable long-term rollout.

      "title": "KernelEvolve: Scaling Agentic Kernel Coding for Heterogeneous AI Accelerators at Meta",
      "abstract": "Excited to share our recent work on KernelEvolve: Scaling Agentic Kernel Coding for Heterogeneous AI Accelerators at Meta . We designed, implemented, and deployed KernelEvolve to optimize a wide variety of production recommendation models across generations of NVIDIA and AMD GPUs, as well as Meta’s latest-generation AI accelerators (MTIA v3) . Writing high-performance GPU kernels is a complex challenge that typically demands years of deep expertise and remains a major focus of industry and academic research. It’s truly impressive to see KernelEvolve not only achieve state-of-the-art results on open benchmarks, but also deliver 1.25–17x speedups across Meta production use cases . This milestone was made possible by outstanding collaboration across Meta—including teams from Monetization Infra and Ranking, FAIR, Compiler, MTIA, Serverless Compute, and more . Thank you to everyone for your dedication and teamwork in making this breakthrough happen! You can read the full paper here: 👉 https://lnkd.in/gdPb43EZ This is only ~1% of the journey. There is much more ahead in 2026 as we continue pushing the boundaries. If your background aligns (Agentic, LLM, RL, AI compiler, Kernels, Inference/training optimization etc.) and you’re interested in joining us on this journey, feel free to DM me. We’re hiring.
