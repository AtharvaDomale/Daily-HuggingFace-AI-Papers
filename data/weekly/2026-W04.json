      "abstract": "🚀 Introducing HERMES: The Future of Real-Time Streaming Video Understanding! While today's Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) perform impressively at offline video comprehension, they often face a \"painful trade-off\" when it comes to real-time streaming video - balancing real-time responses, low memory usage, and high accuracy. To solve this, we introduce the following innovations: 💡 The HERMES Breakthrough: 1️⃣ Novel memory architecture: By deeply analyzing attention mechanisms, we' ve introduced a \"Hierarchical Memory\" approach. The KV Cache is now reimagined as a multi-level memory framework: Shallow layers act as Sensory Memory (events that just happened). Deep layers focus on Long-term Memory (frame-level semantic anchors). Middle layers bridge the gap with Working Memory. 2️⃣ Plug-and-play architecture: HERMES achieves highly efficient KV Cache reuse and optimization strategies including cross-layer memory smoothing and position re-indexing , delivering instant responses without the need for additional training, or auxiliary computations when user queries arrive. 3️⃣ Incredible efficiency and performance: ⚡ Blazing speed: HERMES is 10x faster than previous SOTA in terms of response latency (TTFT)! 🚀 Compact efficiency: Even with 68% fewer video tokens, the model remains rock-solid, achieving up to 11.4% improvement in streaming comprehension tasks! 💾 Memory-friendly: No matter the video length, memory usage stays constant, leaving OOM errors in the past. 🔥 Join us in exploring this breakthrough: If you're passionate about streaming video understanding and efficient inference, we'd love to discuss and collaborate! 🔍 Explore the Details : 🔗 Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14724 💻 Code: https://github.com/haowei-freesky/HERMES 🌐 Project: https://hermes-streaming.github.io/",

      "title": "BayesianVLA: Bayesian Decomposition of Vision Language Action Models via Latent Action Queries",
      "abstract": "🏗️ Architecture BayesianVLA is a novel framework designed to solve the Vision Shortcut problem in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. In current VLA training, goal-driven datasets often make language instructions highly predictable from visual observations alone. This leads to Information Collapse, where the model ignores language and degenerates into a vision-only policy, failing miserably in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. BayesianVLA addresses this by: Bayesian Decomposition : Explicitly modeling a vision-only prior $p(a|v)$ and a language-conditioned posterior $\\pi(a|v, \\ell)$. LLR Optimization : Maximizing the Log-Likelihood Ratio (LLR) to penalize actions that rely solely on visual cues and reward actions that are truly grounded in language instructions. ✨ Key Features Dual-Branch Architecture : Uses learnable Latent Action Queries to decouple vision-only and language-conditioned action distributions. Zero Extra Data : Achieves significant performance gains (e.g., +11.3% on SimplerEnv) using the exact same datasets as baselines. Preserves VLM Intelligence : Effectively regularizes the model to prevent the \"catastrophic forgetting\" of general multimodal reasoning capabilities common in standard VLA fine-tuning.",

By treating masks as new language tokens, SAMTok enables base MLLMs (such as the QwenVL series) to learn pixel-wise capabilities through standard next-token prediction and simple reinforcement learning, without architectural modifications and specialized loss design. SAMTok builds on SAM2 and is trained on 209M diverse masks using a mask encoder and residual vector quantizer to produce discrete, compact, and information-rich tokens. With 5M SAMTok-formatted mask understanding and generation data samples, QwenVL-SAMTok attains state-of-the-art or comparable results on region captioning, region VQA, grounded conversation, referring segmentation, scene graph parsing, and multi-round interactive segmentation.",

      "abstract": "Summary of Key Points Kernel quality is a fundamental bottleneck for modern AI system performance, yet high-quality kernel engineering is expert-intensive, time-consuming, and difficult to scale. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and LLM-based agents enable automated kernel generation and optimization by capturing expert knowledge and supporting iterative, feedback-driven optimization loops. Despite rapid progress, existing work is fragmented and lacks a unified, systematic perspective. This survey provides a structured overview of LLM-based kernel generation methods and agentic optimization workflows, and compiles the key datasets and benchmarks used for training and evaluation. The paper further identifies open challenges and outlines future research directions, aiming to serve as a comprehensive reference for next-generation automated kernel optimization.

      "abstract": "Abstract: Generalizing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to novel video domains is essential for real-world deployment but remains challenging due to the scarcity of labeled data. While In-Context Learning (ICL) offers a training-free adaptation path, standard methods rely on large annotated pools, which are often impractical in specialized environments like industrial or surgical settings since they require the experts' annotations. To bridge this gap, we introduce VIOLA (Video In-cOntext Learning with minimal Annotation), a label-efficient framework that synergizes minimal expert supervision with abundant unlabeled data. First, to maximize the efficiency of a strict annotation budget, we propose density-uncertainty-weighted sampling. Unlike standard diversity or uncertainty strategies that risk selecting visual outliers, our method leverages density estimation to identify samples that are simultaneously diverse, representative, and informative. Second, to utilize the remaining unlabeled data without noise propagation, we construct a hybrid pool and introduce confidence-aware retrieval and confidence-aware prompting. These mechanisms explicitly model label reliability, retrieving demonstrations based on a composite score of similarity and confidence while enabling the MLLM to adaptively distinguish between verified ground truths and noisy pseudo-labels. Extensive experiments across nine diverse benchmarks using four MLLMs demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms various baselines in low-resource settings, achieving robust adaptation with minimal annotation costs.",

We realize a five-qubit instance of the protocol as an inter-register message-transfer pattern within a single circuit, rather than physical signaling, and evaluate its behavior under realistic device noise and compilation constraints. The circuit encodes branch-conditioned evolution of an observer subsystem whose dynamics depend on a control qubit, followed by a controlled transfer operation that probes correlations between conditional measurement contexts. Executing on the ibm_fez backend with 20000 shots, we observe population-based visibility of 0.877, coherence witnesses of 0.840 and -0.811 along orthogonal axes, and a phase-sensitive magnitude of approximately 1.17. While the visibility metric is insensitive to some classes of dephasing, the coherence witnesses provide complementary sensitivity to off-diagonal noise.",

By incorporating an input-dependent gating mechanism to finely balance the two branches, our method attains 90% sparsity and 1.72× inference speedup, while maintaining generation quality comparable to the full attention baseline. Moreover, our finetuning process is highly efficient, requiring only 2,000 video samples and 1,600 training steps with a batch size of 8.",

      "title": "GameTalk: Training LLMs for Strategic Conversation",
      "abstract": "Strategic decision-making in multi-agent settings is a key challenge for large language models (LLMs), particularly when coordination and negotiation must unfold over extended conversations. While recent work has explored the use of LLMs in isolated decision tasks, little attention has been given to optimizing long-term objectives through dialogue. We introduce GameTalk, a framework for training LLMs to make strategic decisions via multi-turn interactions. Unlike prior work that focuses on single-turn objectives or static action prediction, we train LLMs to optimize a global objective across full conversations. We achieve this by adapting fine-tuning methods like GRPO, DPO, and STaR to incorporate reward signals that depend on the entire interaction. We evaluate this approach on a suite of increasingly complex games, designed to stress different aspects of reasoning, coordination, and opponent modeling. Our results show that GameTalk significantly outperforms untrained models, especially under reward shaping, with DPO consistently yielding the strongest gains. These findings position conversational fine-tuning as a promising path for LLMs to reason, negotiate, and act in interactive environments.",
