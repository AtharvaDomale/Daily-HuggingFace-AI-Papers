      "abstract": "🚀 Introducing HERMES: The Future of Real-Time Streaming Video Understanding! While today's Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) perform impressively at offline video comprehension, they often face a \"painful trade-off\" when it comes to real-time streaming video - balancing real-time responses, low memory usage, and high accuracy. To solve this, we introduce the following innovations: 💡 The HERMES Breakthrough: 1️⃣ Novel memory architecture: By deeply analyzing attention mechanisms, we' ve introduced a \"Hierarchical Memory\" approach. The KV Cache is now reimagined as a multi-level memory framework: Shallow layers act as Sensory Memory (events that just happened). Deep layers focus on Long-term Memory (frame-level semantic anchors). Middle layers bridge the gap with Working Memory. 2️⃣ Plug-and-play architecture: HERMES achieves highly efficient KV Cache reuse and optimization strategies including cross-layer memory smoothing and position re-indexing , delivering instant responses without the need for additional training, or auxiliary computations when user queries arrive. 3️⃣ Incredible efficiency and performance: ⚡ Blazing speed: HERMES is 10x faster than previous SOTA in terms of response latency (TTFT)! 🚀 Compact efficiency: Even with 68% fewer video tokens, the model remains rock-solid, achieving up to 11.4% improvement in streaming comprehension tasks! 💾 Memory-friendly: No matter the video length, memory usage stays constant, leaving OOM errors in the past. 🔥 Join us in exploring this breakthrough: If you're passionate about streaming video understanding and efficient inference, we'd love to discuss and collaborate! 🔍 Explore the Details : 🔗 Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14724 💻 Code: https://github.com/haowei-freesky/HERMES 🌐 Project: https://hermes-streaming.github.io/",

      "title": "BayesianVLA: Bayesian Decomposition of Vision Language Action Models via Latent Action Queries",
      "abstract": "🏗️ Architecture BayesianVLA is a novel framework designed to solve the Vision Shortcut problem in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. In current VLA training, goal-driven datasets often make language instructions highly predictable from visual observations alone. This leads to Information Collapse, where the model ignores language and degenerates into a vision-only policy, failing miserably in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. BayesianVLA addresses this by: Bayesian Decomposition : Explicitly modeling a vision-only prior $p(a|v)$ and a language-conditioned posterior $\\pi(a|v, \\ell)$. LLR Optimization : Maximizing the Log-Likelihood Ratio (LLR) to penalize actions that rely solely on visual cues and reward actions that are truly grounded in language instructions. ✨ Key Features Dual-Branch Architecture : Uses learnable Latent Action Queries to decouple vision-only and language-conditioned action distributions. Zero Extra Data : Achieves significant performance gains (e.g., +11.3% on SimplerEnv) using the exact same datasets as baselines. Preserves VLM Intelligence : Effectively regularizes the model to prevent the \"catastrophic forgetting\" of general multimodal reasoning capabilities common in standard VLA fine-tuning.",

By treating masks as new language tokens, SAMTok enables base MLLMs (such as the QwenVL series) to learn pixel-wise capabilities through standard next-token prediction and simple reinforcement learning, without architectural modifications and specialized loss design. SAMTok builds on SAM2 and is trained on 209M diverse masks using a mask encoder and residual vector quantizer to produce discrete, compact, and information-rich tokens. With 5M SAMTok-formatted mask understanding and generation data samples, QwenVL-SAMTok attains state-of-the-art or comparable results on region captioning, region VQA, grounded conversation, referring segmentation, scene graph parsing, and multi-round interactive segmentation.",

      "abstract": "Summary of Key Points Kernel quality is a fundamental bottleneck for modern AI system performance, yet high-quality kernel engineering is expert-intensive, time-consuming, and difficult to scale. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and LLM-based agents enable automated kernel generation and optimization by capturing expert knowledge and supporting iterative, feedback-driven optimization loops. Despite rapid progress, existing work is fragmented and lacks a unified, systematic perspective. This survey provides a structured overview of LLM-based kernel generation methods and agentic optimization workflows, and compiles the key datasets and benchmarks used for training and evaluation. The paper further identifies open challenges and outlines future research directions, aiming to serve as a comprehensive reference for next-generation automated kernel optimization.

      "abstract": "Abstract: Generalizing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to novel video domains is essential for real-world deployment but remains challenging due to the scarcity of labeled data. While In-Context Learning (ICL) offers a training-free adaptation path, standard methods rely on large annotated pools, which are often impractical in specialized environments like industrial or surgical settings since they require the experts' annotations. To bridge this gap, we introduce VIOLA (Video In-cOntext Learning with minimal Annotation), a label-efficient framework that synergizes minimal expert supervision with abundant unlabeled data. First, to maximize the efficiency of a strict annotation budget, we propose density-uncertainty-weighted sampling. Unlike standard diversity or uncertainty strategies that risk selecting visual outliers, our method leverages density estimation to identify samples that are simultaneously diverse, representative, and informative. Second, to utilize the remaining unlabeled data without noise propagation, we construct a hybrid pool and introduce confidence-aware retrieval and confidence-aware prompting. These mechanisms explicitly model label reliability, retrieving demonstrations based on a composite score of similarity and confidence while enabling the MLLM to adaptively distinguish between verified ground truths and noisy pseudo-labels. Extensive experiments across nine diverse benchmarks using four MLLMs demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms various baselines in low-resource settings, achieving robust adaptation with minimal annotation costs.",

We realize a five-qubit instance of the protocol as an inter-register message-transfer pattern within a single circuit, rather than physical signaling, and evaluate its behavior under realistic device noise and compilation constraints. The circuit encodes branch-conditioned evolution of an observer subsystem whose dynamics depend on a control qubit, followed by a controlled transfer operation that probes correlations between conditional measurement contexts. Executing on the ibm_fez backend with 20000 shots, we observe population-based visibility of 0.877, coherence witnesses of 0.840 and -0.811 along orthogonal axes, and a phase-sensitive magnitude of approximately 1.17. While the visibility metric is insensitive to some classes of dephasing, the coherence witnesses provide complementary sensitivity to off-diagonal noise.",

      "abstract": "Strategic decision-making in multi-agent settings is a key challenge for large language models (LLMs), particularly when coordination and negotiation must unfold over extended conversations. While recent work has explored the use of LLMs in isolated decision tasks, little attention has been given to optimizing long-term objectives through dialogue. We introduce GameTalk, a framework for training LLMs to make strategic decisions via multi-turn interactions. Unlike prior work that focuses on single-turn objectives or static action prediction, we train LLMs to optimize a global objective across full conversations. We achieve this by adapting fine-tuning methods like GRPO, DPO, and STaR to incorporate reward signals that depend on the entire interaction. We evaluate this approach on a suite of increasingly complex games, designed to stress different aspects of reasoning, coordination, and opponent modeling. Our results show that GameTalk significantly outperforms untrained models, especially under reward shaping, with DPO consistently yielding the strongest gains. These findings position conversational fine-tuning as a promising path for LLMs to reason, negotiate, and act in interactive environments.",

      "abstract": "Recently, the frontier of Large Language Model (LLM) capabilities has shifted from single-turn code generation to agentic software engineering-a paradigm where models autonomously navigate, edit, and test complex repositories.  While post-training methods have become the de facto approach for code agents, agentic mid-training -mid-training (MT) on large-scale data that mirrors authentic agentic workflows-remains critically underexplored due to substantial resource requirements, despite offering a more scalable path to instilling foundational agentic behaviors than relying solely on expensive reinforcement learning.  A central challenge in realizing effective agentic mid-training is the distribution mismatch between static training data and the dynamic, feedback-rich environment of real development.  To address this, we present a systematic study of agentic mid-training, establishing both the data synthesis principles and training methodology for effective agent development at scale.  Central to our approach is agent-native data -supervision comprising two complementary types of trajectories: contextually-native trajectories that preserve the complete information flow an agent experiences, offering broad coverage and diversity; and environmentally-native trajectories collected from executable repositories where observations stem from actual tool invocations and test executions, providing depth and interaction authenticity.  We verify the model's agentic capabilities on SWE-Bench Verified .  We demonstrate our superiority over the previous open software engineering mid-training recipe Kimi-Dev under two post-training settings with an aligned base model and agentic scaffold, while using less than half mid-training tokens (73.1B).  Besides relative advantage, our best performing 32B and 72B models achieve 56.1% and 58.5% resolution rates, respectively, which are state-of-the-art among open training recipes using agentic scaffolds under their model sizes, despite starting from non-coder Qwen2.5-Base base models.  Beyond these agentic capabilities, we also observe performance gains on general code generation and scientific benchmarks.  We plan to open-source a significant portion of our datasets, recipes, and model checkpoints-resources representing substantial computational investment typically unavailable to the broader community-to facilitate further research in this underexplored paradigm.",

      "abstract": "While synthetic data has proven effective for improving scientific reasoning in the text domain, multimodal reasoning remains constrained by the difficulty of synthesizing scientifically rigorous images. Existing Text-to-Image (T2I) models often produce outputs that are visually plausible yet scientifically incorrect, resulting in a persistent visual-logic divergence that limits their value for downstream reasoning. Motivated by recent advances in next-generation T2I models, we conduct a systematic study of scientific image synthesis across generation paradigms, evaluation, and downstream use. We analyze both direct pixel-based generation and programmatic synthesis, and propose ImgCoder, a logic-driven framework that follows an explicit \"understand - plan - code\" workflow to improve structural precision. To rigorously assess scientific correctness, we introduce SciGenBench, which evaluates generated images based on information utility and logical validity. Our evaluation reveals systematic failure modes in pixel-based models and highlights a fundamental expressiveness-precision trade-off. Finally, we show that fine-tuning Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) on rigorously verified synthetic scientific images yields consistent reasoning gains, with potential scaling trends analogous to the text domain, validating high-fidelity scientific synthesis as a viable path to unlocking massive multimodal reasoning capabilities.",

      "abstract": "General-purpose embedding models have demonstrated strong performance in text retrieval but remain suboptimal for table retrieval, where highly structured content leads to semantic compression and query–table mismatch. Recent LLM-based retrieval augmentation methods mitigate this issue by generating synthetic queries, yet they often rely on heuristic partial-table selection and seldom leverage these synthetic queries as supervision to improve the embedding model. We introduce CGPT, a training framework that enhances table retrieval through LLM-generated supervision. CGPT constructs semantically diverse partial tables by clustering table instances using K-means and sampling across clusters to broaden semantic coverage. An LLM then generates synthetic queries for these partial tables, which are used in hard-negative contrastive fine-tuning to refine the embedding model. Experiments across four public benchmarks (MimoTable, OTTQA, FetaQA, and E2E-WTQ) show that CGPT consistently outperforms the existing baselines with an average R@1 improvement of 16.54%. Under cross-domain evaluation, CGPT further demonstrates strong cross-domain generalization and remains effective even when using smaller LLMs for synthetic query generation. These results indicate that semantically guided partial-table construction, combined with contrastive training from LLM-generated supervision, provides an effective and scalable paradigm for large-scale table retrieval.

      "abstract": "Table retrieval is the task of retrieving the most relevant tables from large-scale corpora given natural language queries. However, structural and semantic discrepancies between unstructured text and structured tables make embedding alignment particularly challenging. Recent methods such as QGpT attempt to enrich table semantics by generating synthetic queries, yet they still rely on coarse partial-table sampling and simple fusion strategies, which limit semantic diversity and hinder effective query–table alignment. We propose STAR (Semantic Table Representation), a lightweight framework that improves semantic table representation through semantic clustering and weighted fusion. STAR first applies header-aware K-means clustering to group semantically similar rows and selects representative centroid instances to construct a diverse partial table. It then generates cluster-specific synthetic queries to comprehensively cover the table's semantic space. Finally, STAR employs weighted fusion strategies to integrate table and query embeddings, enabling fine-grained semantic alignment. This design enables STAR to capture complementary information from structured and textual sources, improving the expressiveness of table representations. Experiments on five benchmarks show that STAR achieves consistently higher Recall than QGpT on all datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of semantic clustering and weighted fusion for robust table representation.

      "abstract": "Generalist LLM agents are often post-trained on a narrow set of environments but deployed across far broader, unseen domains. In this work, we investigate the challenge of agentic post-training when the eventual test domains are unknown. Specifically, we analyze which properties of reinforcement learning (RL) environments and modeling choices have the greatest influence on out-of-domain performance. First, we identify two environment axes that strongly correlate with cross-domain generalization: (i) state information richness, i.e., the amount of information for the agent to process from the state, and (ii) planning complexity, estimated via goal reachability and trajectory length under a base policy. Notably, domain realism and text-level similarity are not the primary factors; for instance, the simple grid-world domain Sokoban leads to even stronger generalization in SciWorld than the more realistic ALFWorld. Motivated by these findings, we further show that increasing state information richness alone can already effectively improve cross-domain robustness. We propose a randomization technique, which is low-overhead and broadly applicable: add small amounts of distractive goal-irrelevant features to the state to make it richer without altering the task. Beyond environment-side properties, we also examine several modeling choices: (a) SFT warmup or mid-training helps prevent catastrophic forgetting during RL but undermines generalization to domains that are not included in the mid-training datamix; and (b) turning on step-by-step thinking during RL, while not always improving in-domain performance, plays a crucial role in preserving generalization.",

      "title": "Least-Loaded Expert Parallelism: Load Balancing An Imbalanced Mixture-of-Experts",
      "abstract": "Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models are typically pre-trained with explicit load-balancing constraints to ensure statistically balanced expert routing. Despite this, we observe that even well-trained MoE models exhibit significantly imbalanced routing. This behavior is arguably natural-and even desirable - as imbalanced routing allows models to concentrate domain-specific knowledge within a subset of experts. Expert parallelism (EP) is designed to scale MoE models by distributing experts across multiple devices, but with a less-discussed assumption of balanced routing. Under extreme imbalance, EP can funnel a disproportionate number of tokens to a small number of experts, leading to compute- and memory-bound failures on overloaded devices during post-training or inference, where explicit load balancing is often inapplicable. We propose Least-Loaded Expert Parallelism (LLEP), a novel EP algorithm that dynamically reroutes excess tokens and associated expert parameters from overloaded devices to underutilized ones. This ensures that all devices complete their workloads within the minimum collective latency while respecting memory constraints. Across different model scales, LLEP achieves up to 5x speedup and 4x reduction in peak memory usage compared to standard EP. This enables faster and higher-throughput post-training and inference, with ~1.9x faster for gpt-oss-120b. We support our method with extensive theoretical analysis and comprehensive empirical evaluations, including ablation studies. These results illuminate key trade-offs and enable a principled framework for hardware-specific hyper-parameter tuning to achieve optimal performance.",

      "abstract": "Alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) aims to align outputs with human preferences, and personalized alignment further adapts models to individual users. This relies on personalized reward models that capture user-specific preferences and automatically provide individualized feedback. However, developing these models faces two critical challenges: the scarcity of feedback from individual users and the need for efficient adaptation to unseen users. We argue that addressing these constraints requires a paradigm shift from fitting data to learn user preferences to learn the process of preference adaptation. To realize this, we propose Meta Reward Modeling (MRM), which reformulates personalized reward modeling as a meta-learning problem. Specifically, we represent each user's reward model as a weighted combination of base reward functions, and optimize the initialization of these weights using a Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML)-style framework to support fast adaptation under limited feedback. To ensure robustness, we introduce the Robust Personalization Objective (RPO), which places greater emphasis on hard-to-learn users during meta optimization. Extensive experiments on personalized preference datasets validate that MRM enhances few-shot personalization, improves user robustness, and consistently outperforms baselines.",

      "abstract": "Accurate transcription and speaker diarization of child–adult spoken interactions are crucial for developmental and clinical research. However, manual annotation is time-consuming and challenging to scale. Existing automated systems typically rely on cascaded speaker diarization and automatic speech recognition pipelines, which can lead to error propagation. This paper presents a unified end-to-end framework that extends the Whisper encoder–decoder architecture to jointly model ASR and child–adult speaker role diarization. The proposed approach integrates: (i) a serialized output training scheme that emits speaker tags and start/end timestamps, (ii) a lightweight frame-level diarization head that enhances speaker-discriminative encoder representations, (iii) diarization-guided silence suppression for improved temporal precision, and (iv) a state-machine-based forced decoding procedure that guarantees structurally valid outputs. Comprehensive evaluations on two datasets demonstrate consistent and substantial improvements over two cascaded baselines, achieving lower multi-talker word error rates and demonstrating competitive diarization accuracy across both Whispersmall and Whisper-large models. These findings highlight the effectiveness and practical utility of the proposed joint modeling framework for generating reliable, speaker-attributed transcripts of child–adult interactions at scale.

A critical gap persists between modern \"stateless\" video architectures and the \"state-centric\" requirements of classic control theory. This survey bridges that divide. We propose a new taxonomy built on State Construction (implicit context vs. explicit latent compression) and Dynamics Modeling . We argue that the field must transition its evaluation standards from simple visual fidelity to functional benchmarks—specifically testing for physical persistence and causal reasoning. Finally, we outline the path forward: solving data-driven memory for persistence and integrating reasoning priors for causality.

      "title": "Diffusion In Diffusion: Reclaiming Global Coherence in Semi-Autoregressive Diffusion",
      "abstract": "One of the most compelling features of global discrete diffusion language models is their global bidirectional contextual capability. However, existing block-based diffusion studies tend to introduce autoregressive priors, which, while offering benefits, can cause models to lose this global coherence at the macro level. To regain global contextual understanding while preserving the advantages of the semi-autoregressive paradigm, we propose Diffusion in Diffusion, a 'draft-then-refine' framework designed to overcome the irreversibility and myopia problems inherent in block diffusion models. Our approach first employs block diffusion to generate rapid drafts using small blocks, then refines these drafts through global bidirectional diffusion with a larger bidirectional receptive field. We utilize snapshot confidence remasking to identify the most critical tokens that require modification, and apply mix-scale training to expand the block diffusion model's global capabilities. Empirical results demonstrate that our approach sets a new benchmark for discrete diffusion models on the OpenWebText dataset. Using only 26% of the fine-tuning budget of baseline models, we reduce generative perplexity from 25.7 to 21.9, significantly narrowing the performance gap with autoregressive models.

But RL research on such systems is often hindered by a complex and brittle software pipeline consisting of external solvers and multiple code bases, making this exciting field inaccessible for many RL researchers. To tackle this challenge, we have developed a standalone, fully differentiable, plug-and-play benchmark for RL in active flow control, implemented in a single PyTorch codebase via PICT, without external solver dependencies. Our FluidGym comes with a collection of standardized environment configurations spanning diverse 3D and multi-agent control tasks. We perform an extensive experimental study with multiple seeds, randomized initial conditions, and separate train/validate/test sets. We compare the default implementations of the two most popular algorithms, PPO and SAC, in the single and multi-agent settings, and also investigate the potential for transfer learning. We hope that this may be of interest to a large number of reinforcement learning researchers who are keen on assessing the most recent trends in basic RL research on a new set of challenging tasks, but otherwise find it difficult to enter the field of fluid mechanics Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15015v1 GitHub: https://github.com/safe-autonomous-systems/fluidgym",

We study this problem by introducing MIR-SafetyBench, the first benchmark focused on multi-image reasoning safety, which consists of 2{,}676 instances across a taxonomy of 9 multi-image relations. Our extensive evaluations on 19 MLLMs reveal a troubling trend: models with more advanced multi-image reasoning can be more vulnerable on MIR-SafetyBench. Beyond attack success rates, we find that many responses labeled as safe are superficial, often driven by misunderstanding or evasive, non-committal replies. We further observe that unsafe generations exhibit lower attention entropy than safe ones on average. This internal signature suggests a possible risk that models may over-focus on task solving while neglecting safety constraints.

      "abstract": "Visual token compression is widely used to accelerate inference in Large Vision–Language Models (LVLMs), enabling deployment in latency- and resource-constrained settings. This paper reveals that such compression introduces a previously overlooked security risk: models that are robust under full-token inference can become highly vulnerable once compression is enabled. We show that this vulnerability is compression-specific and stems from the instability of token-importance ranking, where small, imperceptible perturbations can cause task-critical visual tokens to be discarded. To systematically study this phenomenon, we propose Compression-Aware Attack (CAA), which explicitly targets the token selection mechanism and induces failures only under compressed inference. Extensive experiments across multiple LVLMs, datasets, and compression methods demonstrate a severe efficiency–security trade-off, highlighting the need for robustness-aware compression design in practical LVLM deployments.",

We introduce MortalMATH, a benchmark of 150 scenarios where users request algebra help while describing increasingly life-threatening emergencies (e.g., stroke symptoms, freefall). We find a sharp behavioral split: generalist models (like Llama-3.1) successfully refuse the math to address the danger. In contrast, specialized reasoning models (like Qwen-3-32b and GPT-5-nano) often ignore the emergency entirely, maintaining over 95 percent task completion rates while the user describes dying. Furthermore, the computational time required for reasoning introduces dangerous delays: up to 15 seconds before any potential help is offered.

      "abstract": "🚀 HalluGuard: Demystifying Data-Driven and Reasoning-Driven Hallucinations in LLMs Accepted at ICLR 2026 In this work, we introduce HalluGuard , a unified, theory-driven framework for hallucination detection in large language models , accepted at ICLR 2026 . Rather than treating hallucination as a single failure mode, HalluGuard explicitly decomposes hallucinations into data-driven and reasoning-driven components—and detects both at inference time , with no retraining , no labels , and no external references . 😆 Key Takeaways 🧠 Two Sources of Hallucination LLM hallucinations arise from two fundamentally different mechanisms: Data-driven hallucinations Errors rooted in biased, incomplete, or mismatched knowledge acquired during pretraining or finetuning. Reasoning-driven hallucinations Errors caused by instability and error amplification during multi-step autoregressive decoding. Most existing detectors focus on only one of these. HalluGuard shows that real hallucinations often emerge from their interaction and evolve across decoding steps . 📐 Hallucination Risk Bound (Theory) We introduce a Hallucination Risk Bound , which formally decomposes total hallucination risk into: a representation bias term (training-time mismatch), and a decoding instability term (inference-time amplification). The analysis reveals a key insight: hallucinations originate from semantic approximation gaps and are then exponentially amplified during long-horizon generation . This provides a principled explanation of how hallucinations emerge and evolve in LLMs. 🔍 HalluGuard Score (Method) Building on this theory, we propose HalluGuard , a lightweight NTK-based hallucination score : H A L L U G U A R D ( u h ) = det ⁡ ( K ) + log ⁡ σ max ⁡ − log ⁡ ⁣ ( κ ( K ) 2 ) . \\mathrm{HALLUGUARD}(u_h)\n=\n\\det(K)\n+\n\\log \\sigma_{\\max}\n-\n\\log\\!\\big(\\kappa(K)^2\\big). HALLUGUARD ( u h ​ ) = det ( K ) + lo g σ m a x ​ − lo g ( κ ( K ) 2 ) . Higher HalluGuard score ⇒ lower hallucination risk . 📊 Strong Empirical Results We evaluate HalluGuard across: 10 benchmarks (QA, math reasoning, instruction following), 11 competitive baselines , and 9 LLM backbones (from GPT-2 to 70B-scale models). Results: 🏆 Consistent state-of-the-art AUROC / AUPRC across all task families 🔍 Especially strong gains on multi-step reasoning benchmarks (MATH-500, BBH) 🧩 Robust detection of fine-grained semantic hallucinations (PAWS), even when surface forms are nearly identical 🧭 Beyond Detection: Test-Time Guidance HalluGuard can also be used to guide test-time inference , significantly improving reasoning accuracy by steering generation away from unstable trajectories— without modifying or retraining the model . 🔑 Takeaway HalluGuard (ICLR 2026) provides: a theoretical lens for understanding how hallucinations emerge and evolve, and a practical, plug-and-play detector for modern LLMs. It bridges representation geometry and decoding dynamics, offering a unified foundation for reliable reasoning and uncertainty-aware inference .

      "abstract": "Attention matrices are fundamental to transformer research, supporting a broad range of applications including interpretability, visualization, manipulation, and distillation. Yet, most existing analyses focus on individual attention heads or layers, failing to account for the model's global behavior. While prior efforts have extended attention formulations across multiple heads via averaging and matrix multiplications or incorporated components such as normalization and FFNs, a unified and complete representation that encapsulates all transformer blocks is still lacking. We address this gap by introducing TensorLens, a novel formulation that captures the entire transformer as a single, input-dependent linear operator expressed through a high-order attention-interaction tensor. This tensor jointly encodes attention, FFNs, activations, normalizations, and residual connections, offering a theoretically coherent and expressive linear representation of the model's computation. TensorLens is theoretically grounded and our empirical validation shows that it yields richer representations than previous attention-aggregation methods. Our experiments demonstrate that the attention tensor can serve as a powerful foundation for developing tools aimed at interpretability and model understanding.

      "abstract": "TL;DR : From a world-model perspective, we study when and how visual generation enabled by unified multimodal models (UMMs) benefits reasoning. Humans construct mental models of the world, representing information and knowledge through two complementary channels—verbal and visual—to support reasoning, planning, and decision-making. In contrast, recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and vision–language models (VLMs) largely rely on verbal chain-of-thought reasoning, leveraging primarily symbolic and linguistic world knowledge. Unified multimodal models (UMMs) open a new paradigm by using visual generation for visual world modeling, advancing more human-like reasoning on tasks grounded in the physical world. In this work: We formalize the atomic capabilities of world models and world model-based chain-of-thought reasoning. We highlight the richer informativeness and complementary prior knowledge afforded by visual world modeling, leading to our visual superiority hypothesis for tasks grounded in the physical world. We identify and design tasks that necessitate interleaved visual-verbal CoT reasoning, constructing a new evaluation suite, VisWorld-Eval . Through controlled experiments on BAGEL, we show that interleaved CoT significantly outperforms purely verbal CoT on tasks that favor visual world modeling, strongly supporting our insights.

However, for non-experts, especially those without programming skills, it isn't easy to customize a visualizable environment by themselves. In this paper, we introduce World Craft, an agentic world creation framework to create an executable and visualizable AI Town via user textual descriptions. It consists of two main modules, World Scaffold and World Guild. World Scaffold is a structured and concise standardization to develop interactive game scenes, serving as an efficient scaffolding for LLMs to customize an executable AI Town-like environment. World Guild is a multi-agent framework to progressively analyze users' intents from rough descriptions, and synthesizes required structured contents (e.g., environment layout and assets) for World Scaffold . Moreover, we construct a high-quality error-correction dataset via reverse engineering to enhance spatial knowledge and improve the stability and controllability of layout generation, while reporting multi-dimensional evaluation metrics for further analysis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms existing commercial code agents (Cursor and Antigravity) and LLMs (Qwen3 and Gemini-3-Pro). in scene construction and narrative intent conveyance, providing a scalable solution for the democratization of environment creation.",

We've seen plenty of \"Red Team vs. Blue Team\" setups, but they often suffer from two issues: the Red Team eventually finds one exploit and spams it (mode collapse), or the Blue Team becomes \"safe\" but loses its general reasoning abilities (the alignment tax). This paper introduces TriPlay-RL, which adds a third active player: an Evolving Evaluator. Instead of using a fixed reward model or human labels, all three roles (Attacker, Defender, Evaluator) co-evolve in a closed loop. Why this stands out: No Alignment Tax: The Defender improved safety performance by 10-30% without degrading general reasoning benchmarks. This is usually the hardest part of safety training. Diverse Attacks: They use diversity penalties to stop the Attacker from collapsing into a single pattern, keeping the pressure on the Defender high. Near-Zero Data: It works with minimal manual annotation, making it scalable. It feels like a step closer to an \"AlphaZero\" moment for safety alignment. Highly recommend checking the ablation studies on entropy collapse!",

      "abstract": "With the rise of 1M+ context windows in Gemini and Claude, the biggest debate in AI right now is: \"Do we still need RAG, or should we just dump everything into the prompt?\" Today's pick, FABLE: Forest-Based Adaptive Bi-Path LLM-Enhanced Retrieval for Multi-Document Reasoning, provides a compelling answer: Long context is great, but structured navigation is better (and much cheaper). What makes FABLE stand out from the sea of RAG papers is that it reimagines the LLM's role. It stops treating the LLM as just a \"reader\" and turns it into a \"librarian\": Forests > Flat Chunks: Instead of the traditional \"chunk + vector search\" which loses global context, FABLE uses LLMs to pre-build Hierarchical Knowledge Forests. This allows the system to actively \"zoom in\" for granular details or \"zoom out\" for high-level synthesis depending on the query. The Bi-Path Innovation: It doesn't rely on just one retrieval method. It runs a Bi-Path Strategy: one path uses LLM reasoning to navigate the document structure (symbolic/logic), and the other uses vector propagation (semantic similarity). This hybrid approach captures subtle connections that vector databases often miss. Insane Efficiency: The results are the real hook here. FABLE achieves the same reasoning accuracy as full-context inference (517k tokens) while using only ~31k tokens. That is a 94% reduction in compute/cost without sacrificing quality. Why read this? If you are working on Agents or Multi-Document QA, you know that \"Lost-in-the-middle\" is a real pain. FABLE proves that giving LLMs a map (the semantic forest) is more effective than just giving them a bigger backpack (context window). It beats graph-based baselines like HippoRAG and is a refreshing take on how to scale reasoning without scaling costs. A must-read for anyone trying to optimize RAG pipelines for complex tasks!",

      "title": "Revisiting Parameter Server in LLM Post-Training",
      "abstract": "Modern data parallel (DP) training favors collective communication over parameter servers (PS) for its simplicity and efficiency under balanced workloads. However, the balanced workload assumption no longer holds in large language model (LLM) post-training due to the high variance in sequence lengths. Under imbalanced workloads, collective communication creates synchronization barriers, leading to under-utilization of devices with smaller workloads. This change in training dynamics calls for a revisit of the PS paradigm for its robustness to such imbalance. We propose On-Demand Communication (ODC) , which adapts PS into Fully Sharded Data Parallel (FSDP) by replacing collective all-gather and reduce-scatter with direct point-to-point communication. Compared to FSDP, ODC reduces the synchronization barrier from once per layer to once per minibatch and decouples the workload on each device so that faster workers are not stalled. It also enables simpler and more effective load balancing at the minibatch level. Across diverse LLM post-training tasks, ODC consistently improves device utilization and training throughput, achieving up to a 36% speedup over standard FSDP. These results demonstrate that ODC is a superior fit for the prevalent imbalanced workloads in LLM post-training. Our implementation of ODC and integration with FSDP is open-sourced at github .",

      "abstract": "Verilog’s design cycle is inherently labor-intensive and necessitates extensive domain expertise. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising pathway toward automation, their limited training data and intrinsic sequential reasoning fail to capture the strict formal logic and concurrency inherent in hardware systems. To overcome these barriers, we present EvolVE, the first framework to analyze multiple evolution strategies on chip design tasks, revealing that Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) excels at maximizing functional correctness, while Idea-Guided Refinement (IGR) proves superior for optimization. We further leverage Structured Testbench Generation (STG) to accelerate the evolutionary process. To address the lack of complex optimization benchmarks, we introduce IC-RTL, targeting industry-scale problems derived from the National Integrated Circuit Contest. Evaluations establish EvolVE as the new state-of-the-art, achieving 98.1% on VerilogEval v2 and 92% on RTLLM v2. Furthermore, on the industry-scale IC-RTL suite, our framework surpasses reference implementations authored by contest participants, reducing the Power, Performance, Area (PPA) product by up to 66% in Huffman Coding and 17% in the geometric mean across all problems. The source code of the IC-RTL benchmark is available at https://github.com/weiber2002/ICRTL .",

      "title": "CooperBench: Why Coding Agents Cannot be Your Teammates Yet",
      "abstract": "Resolving team conflicts requires not only task-specific competence, but also social intelligence to find common ground and build consensus. As AI agents increasingly collaborate on complex work, they must develop coordination capabilities to function as effective teammates. Yet we hypothesize that current agents lack these capabilities. To test this, we introduce CooperBench, a benchmark of over 600 collaborative coding tasks across 12 libraries in 4 programming languages. Each task assigns two agents different features that can be implemented independently but may conflict without proper coordination. Tasks are grounded in real open-source repositories with expert-written tests. Evaluating state-of-the-art coding agents, we observe the curse of coordination: agents achieve on average 30% lower success rates when working together compared to performing both tasks individually. This contrasts sharply with human teams, where adding teammates typically improves productivity. Our analysis reveals three key issues: (1) communication channels become jammed with vague, ill-timed, and inaccurate messages; (2) even with effective communication, agents deviate from their commitments; and (3) agents often hold incorrect expectations about others' plans and communication. Through large-scale simulation, we also observe rare but interesting emergent coordination behavior including role division, resource division, and negotiation. Our research presents a novel benchmark for collaborative coding and calls for a shift from pursuing individual agent capability to developing social intelligence.",

A key innovation is Semantic Routing, which dynamically classifies atomic claims to handle non-formalizable natural language; verifiable logic is sent to SMT solvers (Z3) for proof, while ambiguous or commonsense claims are routed to a consensus-based \"soft verifier,\" preventing the system from breaking on vague predicates. Furthermore, we replace generic error signals with actionable feedback via Minimal Correction Subsets (MCS), which pinpoint the precise subset of conflicting claims to revise, enabling the model to iteratively refine its reasoning from \"probabilistic\" to \"provable\" with an 18.7% performance uplift",

We present RIR-Mega-Speech, a corpus of approximately 117.5 hours created by convolving LibriSpeech utterances with roughly 5,000 simulated room impulse responses from the RIR-Mega collection. Every file includes RT60, direct-to-reverberant ratio (DRR), and clarity index (C_{50}) computed from the source RIR using clearly defined, reproducible procedures. We also provide scripts to rebuild the dataset and reproduce all evaluation results. Using Whisper small on 1,500 paired utterances, we measure 5.20% WER (95% CI: 4.69--5.78) on clean speech and 7.70% (7.04--8.35) on reverberant versions, corresponding to a paired increase of 2.50 percentage points (2.06--2.98). This represents a 48% relative degradation. WER increases monotonically with RT60 and decreases with DRR, consistent with prior perceptual studies. While the core finding that reverberation harms recognition is well established, we aim to provide the community with a standardized resource where acoustic conditions are transparent and results can be verified independently. The repository includes one-command rebuild instructions for both Windows and Linux environments.",

      "title": "MMFineReason: Closing the Multimodal Reasoning Gap via Open Data-Centric Methods",
      "abstract": "Recent advances in Vision Language Models (VLMs) have driven significant progress in visual reasoning. However, open-source VLMs still lag behind proprietary systems, largely due to the lack of high-quality reasoning data. Existing datasets offer limited coverage of challenging domains such as STEM diagrams and visual puzzles, and lack consistent, long-form Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations essential for eliciting strong reasoning capabilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce MMFineReason, a large-scale multimodal reasoning dataset comprising 1.8M samples and 5.1B solution tokens, featuring high-quality reasoning annotations distilled from Qwen3-VL-235B-A22B-Thinking. The dataset is established via a systematic three-stage pipeline: (1) large-scale data collection and standardization, (2) CoT rationale generation, and (3) comprehensive selection based on reasoning quality and difficulty awareness. The resulting dataset spans STEM problems, visual puzzles, games, and complex diagrams, with each sample annotated with visually grounded reasoning traces. We fine-tune Qwen3-VL-Instruct on MMFineReason to develop MMFineReason-2B/4B/8B versions. Our models establish new state-of-the-art results for their size class. Notably, MMFineReason-4B succesfully surpasses Qwen3-VL-8B-Thinking, and MMFineReason-8B even outperforms Qwen3-VL-30B-A3B-Thinking while approaching Qwen3-VL-32B-Thinking, demonstrating remarkable parameter efficiency. Crucially, we uncover a \"less is more\" phenomenon via our difficulty-aware filtering strategy: a subset of just 7% (123K samples) achieves performance comparable to the full dataset. Notably, we reveal a synergistic effect where reasoning-oriented data composition simultaneously boosts general capabilities.",

(2) Inherent efficiency: at compression ratio R=2, attention computation reduces by R²× and KV cache by R×, achieving prefill speedups up to 175% and decoding speedups up to 117%. (3) Minimal architectural changes (chunk module + decoder QKV projectors) enable straightforward deployment in existing MoE systems.

      "abstract": "The evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) into autonomous agents necessitates the management of extensive, dynamic contexts. Current benchmarks, however, remain largely static, relying on passive retrieval tasks that fail to simulate the complexities of agent-environment interaction, such as non-linear reasoning and iterative feedback. To address this, we introduce \\textbf{AgentLongBench}, which evaluates agents through simulated environment rollouts based on Lateral Thinking Puzzles. This framework generates rigorous interaction trajectories across knowledge-intensive and knowledge-free scenarios. Experiments with state-of-the-art models and memory systems (32K to 4M tokens) expose a critical weakness: while adept at static retrieval, agents struggle with the dynamic information synthesis essential for workflows. Our analysis indicates that this degradation is driven by the minimum number of tokens required to resolve a query. This factor explains why the high information density inherent in massive tool responses poses a significantly greater challenge than the memory fragmentation typical of long-turn dialogues. The code is available at https://github.com/euReKa025/AgentLongBench .",

      "abstract": "While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in language-based agentic tasks, their applicability to unseen, nonlinguistic environments (e.g., symbolic or spatial tasks) remains limited. Previous work attributes this performance gap to the mismatch between the pretraining distribution and the testing distribution. In this work, we demonstrate the primary bottleneck is the prohibitive cost of exploration: mastering these tasks requires extensive trial-and-error, which is computationally unsustainable for parameter-heavy LLMs operating in a high dimensional semantic space. To address this, we propose SCOUT (Sub-Scale Collaboration On Unseen Tasks), a novel framework that decouples exploration from exploitation. We employ lightweight \"scouts\" (e.g., small MLPs) to probe environmental dynamics at a speed and scale far exceeding LLMs. The collected trajectories are utilized to bootstrap the LLM via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), followed by multi-turn Reinforcement Learning (RL) to activate its latent world knowledge. Empirically, SCOUT enables a Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct model to achieve an average score of 0.86, significantly outperforming proprietary models, including Gemini-2.5-Pro (0.60), while saving about 60% GPU hours consumption.",

      "abstract": "Most offline preference optimization methods (e.g., DPO) constrain policy updates using token-level divergences. However, token-space similarity is often a weak proxy for semantic or structural behavior. We propose GANPO, a plug-and-play regularizer that introduces latent-space adversarial regularization, aligning the latent representation distributions of a policy and a reference model via a principled GAN-style divergence. We find consistent performance improvements. GANPO yields consistent gains across model architectures when integrated into OPO-style methods on AlpacaEval. We also find that structure is preserved. The adversarial objective acts as a geometry-preserving regularizer. Unlike DPO, which often degrades at high sampling temperatures (T ≥ 1.0), GANPO maintains structural coherence in high-entropy settings. If you’re interested in alignment, GANs, or the limitations of KL-divergence–based regularization, feel free to check out the paper.",

Most recent progress in LLM reasoning comes from RL post-training (GRPO, verifiers, rewards). But there’s growing evidence that these gains may come less from learning new capabilities and more from reshaping the distribution of outputs. In our new work, we take that idea seriously. We show that: Reasoning trajectories already exist in base models What matters is how you sample, not how you retrain The global power distribution can be approximated autoregressively, without MCMC The result is a training-free, verifier-free inference-time method that: ⚡ Matches GRPO-style post-training ⏱ Is ~10× faster than MCMC-based power sampling 🧪 Requires no rewards, no finetuning, no verifier Conceptually, the key insight is simple: Power sampling ≈ low-temperature sampling × future-aware token scaling This lets us recover global reasoning behaviour token by token, without expensive trajectory-level inference.",

Token-level Filtering vs Document-level Filtering (Figure 3) Token filtering Pareto-dominates document filtering : Can achieve equal reduction in undesired capabilities (equal medical loss) at lower cost to desired capabilities (lower biology loss) More precise filtering preserves beneficial content better 2. Scaling Effects (Figures 1, 4, 5, 6) Filtering gets more effective with scale : 1.8B parameter models see 7,000× compute slowdown on medical domain Document filtering: ~30× slowdown Token removal: >7,000× slowdown Multiple choice evaluation : Models score near chance on MedMCQA and MedQA-USMLE (medical), but maintain performance on retain domains Free response : Token filtering reduces medical answer correctness up to 20×, relevance/coherence 3× compared to baseline 3. Robustness to Attacks (Figure 7) 10× more robust than unlearning against adversarial finetuning attacks for 1.8B models State-of-the-art unlearning (RMU) requires 13× fewer tokens to recover capabilities compared to token removal 4. Alignment Compatibility (Figures 8, 9) Models can still be aligned on forget domain : Token-level filtering makes refusal training easier (2× better refusal generalization) Document filtering struggles with alignment generalization Linear probes show models can distinguish forget vs. retain tokens despite filtering 5. Classifier Training (Table 1, Figure 11) Small, task-specific models outperform large general ones : 224M parameter biLM achieves 0.894 F1 on test set Outperforms 395M ModernBERT-large (0.794 F1) Domain-specific pretraining improves performance 6. Label Quality Tolerance (Figures 12, 13, 14, 15) Robust to imperfect labels : Aggressive filtering with sufficient compute can overcome label noise Token-level classifiers generalize from weak labels better than document-level Can trade precision for recall to maintain effectiveness",

      "abstract": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) suffer from cross-modal hallucinations, where one modality inappropriately influences generation about another, leading to fabricated output. This exposes a more fundamental deficiency in modality-interaction control. To address this, we propose Modality-Adaptive Decoding (MAD), a training-free method that adaptively weights modality-specific decoding branches based on task requirements. MAD leverages the model's inherent ability to self-assess modality relevance by querying which modalities are needed for each task. The extracted modality probabilities are then used to adaptively weight contrastive decoding branches, enabling the model to focus on relevant information while suppressing cross-modal interference. Extensive experiments on CMM and AVHBench demonstrate that MAD significantly reduces cross-modal hallucinations across multiple audio-visual language models (7.8% and 2.0% improvements for VideoLLaMA2-AV, 8.7% and 4.7% improvements for Qwen2.5-Omni). Our approach demonstrates that explicit modality awareness through self-assessment is crucial for robust multimodal reasoning, offering a principled extension to existing contrastive decoding methods.",

      "abstract": "The ability of visuomotor policies to generalize across tasks and environments critically depends on the structure of the underlying visual representations. While most state-of-the-art robot policies rely on either global or dense features from pre-trained vision models, these approaches often entangle task-relevant and irrelevant signals, limiting their robustness to visual distribution shifts. In this paper, we investigate Slot-based Object-Centric Representations (SOCRs) as a structured alternative that decomposes scenes into a finite set of object-like entities. We present the first large-scale, systematic comparison of global, dense, and object-centric representations across diverse simulated (METAWORLD, LIBERO) and real-world robotic manipulation tasks. Our results show that SOCRs enable superior policy performance and significantly improve generalization under shifts in lighting, texture, and clutter— even without task-specific tuning. We further demonstrate that pretraining SOCRs on robotic video datasets amplifies these benefits. Our findings highlight the importance of structured visual abstraction in robotic perception and suggest that SOCRs offer a promising pathway toward more robust and generaliz- able manipulation policies.",
