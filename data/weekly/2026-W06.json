      "abstract": "Most Large Language Model (LLM) agent memory systems rely on a small set of static, hand-designed operations for extracting memory. These fixed procedures hard-code human priors about what to store and how to revise memory, making them rigid under diverse interaction patterns and inefficient on long histories. To this end, we present \\textbf{MemSkill}, which reframes these operations as learnable and evolvable memory skills, structured and reusable routines for extracting, consolidating, and pruning information from interaction traces. Inspired by the design philosophy of agent skills, MemSkill employs a \\emph{controller} that learns to select a small set of relevant skills, paired with an LLM-based \\emph{executor} that produces skill-guided memories. Beyond learning skill selection, MemSkill introduces a \\emph{designer} that periodically reviews hard cases where selected skills yield incorrect or incomplete memories, and evolves the skill set by proposing refinements and new skills. Together, MemSkill forms a closed-loop procedure that improves both the skill-selection policy and the skill set itself. Experiments on LoCoMo, LongMemEval, HotpotQA, and ALFWorld demonstrate that MemSkill improves task performance over strong baselines and generalizes well across settings. Further analyses shed light on how skills evolve, offering insights toward more adaptive, self-evolving memory management for LLM agents.

      "abstract": "High-quality kernel is critical for scalable AI systems, and enabling LLMs to generate such code would advance AI development. However, training LLMs for this task requires sufficient data, a robust environment, and the process is often vulnerable to reward hacking and lazy optimization. In these cases, models may hack training rewards and prioritize trivial correctness over meaningful speedup. In this paper, we systematically study reinforcement learning (RL) for kernel generation. We first design KernelGYM, a robust distributed GPU environment that supports reward hacking check, data collection from multi-turn interactions and long-term RL training. Building on KernelGYM , we investigate effective multi-turn RL methods and identify a biased policy gradient issue caused by self-inclusion in GRPO. To solve this, we propose Turn-level Reinforce-Leave-One-Out ( TRLOO ) to provide unbiased advantage estimation for multi-turn RL. To alleviate lazy optimization, we incorporate mismatch correction for training stability and introduce Profiling-based Rewards ( PR ) and Profiling-based Rejection Sampling ( PRS ) to overcome the issue. The trained model, this Dr. Kernel-14B, reaches performance competitive with Claude-4.5-Sonnet in Kernelbench. Finally, we study sequential test-time scaling for this Dr. Kernel-14B. On the KernelBench Level-2 subset, 31.6% of the generated kernels achieve at least a 1.2x speedup over the Torch reference, surpassing Claude-4.5-Sonnet (26.7%) and GPT-5 (28.6%). When selecting the best candidate across all turns, this 1.2x speedup rate further increases to 47.8%.

      "abstract": "Training-time privileged information (PI) can enable language models to succeed on tasks they would otherwise fail, making it a powerful tool for reinforcement learning in hard, long-horizon settings. However, transferring capabilities learned with PI to policies that must act without it at inference time remains a fundamental challenge. We study this problem in the context of distilling frontier models for multi-turn agentic environments, where closed-source systems typically hide their internal reasoning and expose only action trajectories. This breaks standard distillation pipelines, since successful behavior is observable but the reasoning process is not. For this, we introduce {\\pi}-Distill, a joint teacher-student objective that trains a PI-conditioned teacher and an unconditioned student simultaneously using the same model. Additionally, we also introduce On-Policy Self-Distillation (OPSD), an alternative approach that trains using Reinforcement Learning (RL) with a reverse KL-penalty between the student and the PI-conditioned teacher. We show that both of these algorithms effectively distill frontier agents using action-only PI. Specifically we find that {\\pi}-Distill and in some cases OPSD, outperform industry standard practices (Supervised finetuning followed by RL) that assume access to full Chain-of-Thought supervision across multiple agentic benchmarks, models, and forms of PI. We complement our results with extensive analysis that characterizes the factors enabling effective learning with PI, focusing primarily on {\\pi}-Distill and characterizing when OPSD is competitive.",

However, in agentic settings, LLMs often struggle to anticipate action consequences and adapt to environment dynamics, highlighting the need for world-modeling capabilities in LLM-based agents. We propose Reinforcement World Model Learning (RWML), a self-supervised method that learns action-conditioned world models for LLM-based agents on textual states using sim-to-real gap rewards. Our method aligns simulated next states produced by the model with realized next states observed from the environment, encouraging consistency between internal world simulations and actual environment dynamics in a pre-trained embedding space. Unlike next-state token prediction, which prioritizes token-level fidelity (i.e., reproducing exact wording) over semantic equivalence and can lead to model collapse, our method provides a more robust training signal and is empirically less susceptible to reward hacking than LLM-as-a-judge. We evaluate our method on ALFWorld and τ2 Bench and observe significant gains over the base model, despite being entirely self-supervised. When combined with task-success rewards, our method outperforms direct task-success reward RL by 6.9 and 5.7 points on ALFWorld and τ2 Bench respectively, while matching the performance of expert-data training.",

      "abstract": "Despite strong performance on existing benchmarks, it remains unclear whether large language models can reason over genuinely novel scientific information. Most evaluations score end-to-end RAG pipelines, where reasoning is confounded with retrieval and toolchain choices, and the signal is further contaminated by parametric memorization and open-web volatility. We introduce DeR2, a controlled deep-research sandbox that isolates document-grounded reasoning while preserving core difficulties of deep search: multi-step synthesis, denoising, and evidence-based conclusion making. DeR2 decouples evidence access from reasoning via four regimes--Instruction-only, Concepts (gold concepts without documents), Related-only (only relevant documents), and Full-set (relevant documents plus topically related distractors)--yielding interpretable regime gaps that operationalize retrieval loss vs. reasoning loss and enable fine-grained error attribution. To prevent parametric leakage, we apply a two-phase validation that requires parametric failure without evidence while ensuring oracle-concept solvability. To ensure reproducibility, each instance provides a frozen document library (drawn from 2023-2025 theoretical papers) with expert-annotated concepts and validated rationales. Experiments across a diverse set of state-of-the-art foundation models reveal substantial variation and significant headroom: some models exhibit mode-switch fragility, performing worse with the Full-set than with Instruction-only, while others show structural concept misuse, correctly naming concepts but failing to execute them as procedures.",

While recent methods often rely on heuristic approaches to balance efficiency and quality, the fundamental relationship between original and synthetic data remains underexplored. This paper revisits knowledge distillation-based dataset distillation within a solid theoretical framework. We introduce the concepts of Informativeness and Utility, capturing crucial information within a sample and essential samples in the training set, respectively. Building on these principles, we define optimal dataset distillation mathematically. We then present InfoUtil, a framework that balances informativeness and utility in synthesizing the distilled dataset. InfoUtil incorporates two key components: (1) game-theoretic informativeness maximization using Shapley Value attribution to extract key information from samples, and (2) principled utility maximization by selecting globally influential samples based on Gradient Norm.

      "abstract": "As Large Language Models increasingly automate complex, long-horizon tasks such as \\emph{vibe coding}, a supervision gap has emerged. While models excel at execution, users often struggle to guide them effectively due to insufficient domain expertise, the difficulty of articulating precise intent, and the inability to reliably validate complex outputs. It presents a critical challenge in scalable oversight: enabling humans to responsibly steer AI systems on tasks that surpass their own ability to specify or verify. To tackle this, we propose Scalable Interactive Oversight, a framework that decomposes complex intent into a recursive tree of manageable decisions to amplify human supervision. Rather than relying on open-ended prompting, our system elicits low-burden feedback at each node and recursively aggregates these signals into precise global guidance. Validated in web development task, our framework enables non-experts to produce expert-level Product Requirement Documents, achieving a 54% improvement in alignment. Crucially, we demonstrate that this framework can be optimized via Reinforcement Learning using only online user feedback, offering a practical pathway for maintaining human control as AI scales.",

Meanwhile, LLM-based retrievers have demonstrated strong capability in following instructions or reasoning. This raises a critical question: can LLM-based retrievers effectively contribute to deep research agent workflows? To investigate this, we introduce SAGE, a benchmark for scientific literature retrieval comprising 1,200 queries across four scientific domains, with a 200,000-paper retrieval corpus. We evaluate six deep research agents and find that all systems struggle with reasoning-intensive retrieval. Using DR Tulu as backbone, we further compare BM25 and LLM-based retrievers (i.e. ReasonIR and gte-Qwen2-7B-instruct) as alternative search tools. Surprisingly, BM25 significantly outperforms LLM-based retrievers by approximately 30%, as existing agents generate keyword-oriented sub-queries. To improve performance, we propose a corpus-level test-time scaling framework that uses LLMs to augment documents with metadata and keywords, making retrieval easier for off-the-shelf retrievers. This yields 8% and 2% gains on short-form and open-ended questions, respectively.",

      "abstract": "We propose DASH ( D istributed A ccelerated SH ampoo), a faster and more accurate version of Distributed Shampoo. To make it faster, we stack the blocks extracted from the preconditioners to obtain a 3D tensor, which are inverted efficiently using batch-matmuls via iterative procedures. To make it more accurate, we introduce an existing iterative method from Numerical Linear Algebra called Newton-DB, which is more accurate than the existing Coupled Newton implemented in Distributed Shampoo. These iterative procedures usually require the largest eigen-value of the input matrix to be upper bounded by 1, which should be obtained by scaling the input matrix. In theory, one should divide by the true largest eigen-value of the matrix, which is expensive to compute in Distributed Shampoo. Before our work, the simplest scaling was Frobenius norm, which is usually much larger than the largest eigen-value. Since we work with all blocks in parallel in a stacked form, our implementation allows running Power-Iteration to estimate the largest eigen-value for all blocks in one shot. Why is this better? When we scale the input matrix by Frobenius norm, the spectrum is shifted towards zero. We show that iterative procedures require more steps to converge for small eigen-values compared to larger ones. Therefore, scaling by an approximation of the largest eigen-value is desired and in our DASH implementation this is cheaper and therefore leads to faster training and more accurate models.

However, existing approaches remain largely language-driven, relying on static visual encodings and lacking the ability to actively verify fine-grained visual evidence, which often leads to speculative reasoning in visually ambiguous cases. We propose V-Retrver, an evidence-driven retrieval framework that reformulates multimodal retrieval as an agentic reasoning process grounded in visual inspection. V-Retrver enables an MLLM to selectively acquire visual evidence during reasoning via external visual tools, performing a multimodal interleaved reasoning process that alternates between hypothesis generation and targeted visual verification.To train such an evidence-gathering retrieval agent, we adopt a curriculum-based learning strategy combining supervised reasoning activation, rejection-based refinement, and reinforcement learning with an evidence-aligned objective. Experiments across multiple multimodal retrieval benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements in retrieval accuracy (with 23.0% improvements on average), perception-driven reasoning reliability, and generalization.",

CatRAG introduces a context-aware traversal framework that transforms the static KG into a query-adaptive navigation structure. By integrating symbolic anchoring and dynamic edge weighting, the system effectively prunes irrelevant paths and amplifies those aligned with the query’s specific intent. A key finding of our work is that while standard recall metrics show modest gains, there is a significant improvement in \"reasoning completeness\"—the ability to recover the entire evidence chain without gaps. This shift from partial context retrieval to grounded reasoning paths is a necessary step for robust multi-hop RAG. We look forward to discussing the implications of dynamic graph steering and how these techniques might scale to increasingly large and heterogeneous knowledge structures.",

      "abstract": "Adaptive 1D Video Diffusion Autoencoder Recent video generation models largely rely on video autoencoders that compress pixel-space videos into latent representations. However, existing video autoencoders suffer from three major limitations: (1) fixed-rate compression that wastes tokens on simple videos, (2) inflexible CNN architectures that prevent variable-length latent modeling, and (3) deterministic decoders that struggle to recover appropriate details from compressed latents. To address these issues, we propose One-Dimensional Diffusion Video Autoencoder (One-DVA), a transformer-based framework for adaptive 1D encoding and diffusion-based decoding. The encoder employs query-based vision transformers to extract spatiotemporal features and produce latent representations, while a variable-length dropout mechanism dynamically adjusts the latent length. The decoder is a pixel-space diffusion transformer that reconstructs videos with the latents as input conditions. With a two-stage training strategy, One-DVA achieves performance comparable to 3D-CNN VAEs on reconstruction metrics at identical compression ratios. More importantly, it supports adaptive compression and thus can achieve higher compression ratios. To better support downstream latent generation, we further regularize the One-DVA latent distribution for generative modeling and fine-tune its decoder to mitigate artifacts caused by the generation process.",

We propose PhysicsAgentABM, which shifts inference to behaviorally coherent agent clusters: state-specialized symbolic agents encode mechanistic transition priors, a multimodal neural transition model captures temporal and interaction dynamics, and uncertainty-aware epistemic fusion yields calibrated cluster-level transition distributions. Individual agents then stochastically realize transitions under local constraints, decoupling population inference from entity-level variability. We further introduce ANCHOR, an LLM agent-driven clustering strategy based on cross-contextual behavioral responses and a novel contrastive loss, reducing LLM calls by up to 6-8 times. Experiments across public health, finance, and social sciences show consistent gains in event-time accuracy and calibration over mechanistic, neural, and LLM baselines. By re-architecting generative ABM around population-level inference with uncertainty-aware neuro-symbolic fusion, PhysicsAgentABM establishes a new paradigm for scalable and calibrated simulation with LLMs.",

      "abstract": "Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) deliver strong long-context processing capability in a non-autoregressive decoding paradigm. However, the considerable computational cost of bidirectional full attention limits the inference efficiency. Although sparse attention is promising, existing methods remain ineffective. This stems from the need to estimate attention importance for tokens yet to be decoded, while the unmasked token positions are unknown during diffusion. In this paper, we present Focus-dLLM, a novel training-free attention sparsification framework tailored for accurate and efficient long-context dLLM inference. Based on the finding that token confidence strongly correlates across adjacent steps, we first design a past confidence-guided indicator to predict unmasked regions. Built upon this, we propose a sink-aware pruning strategy to accurately estimate and remove redundant attention computation, while preserving highly influential attention sinks. To further reduce overhead, this strategy reuses identified sink locations across layers, leveraging the observed cross-layer consistency. Experimental results show that our method offers more than 29× lossless speedup under 32K context length.",

      "abstract": "Current Vision–Language–Action (VLA) models rely on fixed computational depth, expending the same amount of compute on simple adjustments and complex multi-step manipulation. While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting enables variable computation, it scales memory linearly and is ill-suited for continuous action spaces. We introduce Recurrent-Depth VLA (RD-VLA), an architecture that achieves computational adaptivity via latent iterative refinement rather than explicit token generation. RD-VLA employs a recurrent, weight-tied action head that supports arbitrary inference depth with a constant memory footprint. The model is trained using truncated backpropagation through time (TBPTT) to efficiently supervise the refinement process. At inference, RD-VLA dynamically allocates compute using an adaptive stopping criterion based on latent convergence. Experiments on challenging manipulation tasks show that recurrent depth is critical: tasks that fail entirely (0% success) with single-iteration inference exceed 90% success with four iterations, while simpler tasks saturate rapidly. RD-VLA provides a scalable path to test-time compute in robotics, replacing token-based reasoning with latent reasoning to achieve constant memory usage and up to 80× inference speedup over prior reasoning-based VLA models.",

      "abstract": "Deploying GRPO on Flow Matching models has proven effective for text-to-image generation. However, existing paradigms typically propagate an outcome-based reward to all preceding denoising steps without distinguishing the local effect of each step. Moreover, current group-wise ranking mainly compares trajectories at matched timesteps and ignores within-trajectory dependencies, where certain early denoising actions can affect later states via delayed, implicit interactions. We propose TurningPoint-GRPO (TP-GRPO), a GRPO framework that alleviates step-wise reward sparsity and explicitly models long-term effects within the denoising trajectory. TP-GRPO makes two key innovations: (i) it replaces outcome-based rewards with step-level incremental rewards, providing a dense, step-aware learning signal that better isolates each denoising action's \"pure\" effect, and (ii) it identifies turning points-steps that flip the local reward trend and make subsequent reward evolution consistent with the overall trajectory trend-and assigns these actions an aggregated long-term reward to capture their delayed impact. Turning points are detected solely via sign changes in incremental rewards, making TP-GRPO efficient and hyperparameter-free. Extensive experiments also demonstrate that TP-GRPO exploits reward signals more effectively and consistently improves generation.",

      "abstract": "Recent advancements in image generation models have enabled the prediction of future Graphical User Interface (GUI) states based on user instructions. However, existing benchmarks primarily focus on general domain visual fidelity, leaving the evaluation of state transitions and temporal coherence in GUI-specific contexts underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce GEBench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating dynamic interaction and temporal coherence in GUI generation. GEBench comprises 700 carefully curated samples spanning five task categories, covering both single-step interactions and multi-step trajectories across real-world and fictional scenarios, as well as grounding point localization. To support systematic evaluation, we propose GE-Score, a novel five-dimensional metric that assesses Goal Achievement, Interaction Logic, Content Consistency, UI Plausibility, and Visual Quality. Extensive evaluations on current models indicate that while they perform well on single-step transitions, they struggle significantly with maintaining temporal coherence and spatial grounding over longer interaction sequences. Our findings identify icon interpretation, text rendering, and localization precision as critical bottlenecks. This work provides a foundation for systematic assessment and suggests promising directions for future research toward building high-fidelity generative GUI environments.

      "abstract": "Memory is increasingly central to Large Language Model (LLM) agents operating beyond a single context window, yet most existing systems rely on offline, query-agnostic memory construction that can be inefficient and may discard query-critical information. Although runtime memory utilization is a natural alternative, prior work often incurs substantial overhead and offers limited explicit control over the performance-cost trade-off. In this work, we present BudgetMem, a runtime agent memory framework for explicit, query-aware performance-cost control. BudgetMem structures memory processing as a set of memory modules, each offered in three budget tiers (i.e., Low/Mid/High). A lightweight router performs budget-tier routing across modules to balance task performance and memory construction cost, which is implemented as a compact neural policy trained with reinforcement learning. Using BudgetMem as a unified testbed, we study three complementary strategies for realizing budget tiers: implementation (method complexity), reasoning (inference behavior), and capacity (module model size). Across LoCoMo, LongMemEval, and HotpotQA, BudgetMem surpasses strong baselines when performance is prioritized (i.e., high-budget setting), and delivers better accuracy-cost frontiers under tighter budgets. Moreover, our analysis disentangles the strengths and weaknesses of different tiering strategies, clarifying when each axis delivers the most favorable trade-offs under varying budget regimes.",

Data: We collected a new dataset of reasoning trajectories from symbolic tasks to focus purely on logic, stripping away the distraction of real-world knowledge. Method: We tested various ways to induce these skills intoLLMs, ranging from simple fine-tuning to more advanced structural changes like Mixture-of-Experts (MoE). Result: Focusing on these fundamental paradigms led to significant performance boosts (up to 14.60 points) when the models were tested on real-world, natural language tasks they hadn't seen before.",

To address the scarcity of high-fidelity training data and the distributional mismatch where models struggle to recover from their own mistakes, the framework employs two key phases: Environment Synthesis: It uses a multi-agent refinement loop to generate diverse, functionally valid tasks and verifiable Docker containers. Trajectory Collection: It utilizes a Generator-Critic protocol that actively injects errors into trajectories to teach models how to diagnose and recover from runtime failures. The resulting model, TermiGen-Qwen2.5-Coder-32B, achieves a state-of-the-art 31.3% pass rate on TerminalBench, outperforming existing open-source baselines and even surpassing proprietary models like GPT-4o-mini.",

      "abstract": "Solving open-ended science questions remains challenging for large language models, particularly due to inherently unreliable supervision and evaluation. The bottleneck lies in the data construction and reward design for scientific post-training. We develop a large-scale, systematic data processing pipeline that transforms heterogeneous open-source science data into Dr. SCI dataset, which comprises of 1M questions across eight STEM subjects, with explicit verifiable/open-ended splits, scalable difficulty annotation, and fine-grained rubrics that operationalize evaluation for open-ended answers. Building on this dataset, we propose the Dr. SCI post-training pipeline, which redesigns the standard SFT -> RL workflow through three components: (i) Exploration-Expanding SFT, which broadens the model's reasoning pattern coverage prior to RL; (ii) Dynamic Difficulty Curriculum, which adapts training data to the model's evolving scientific capability; and (iii) SciRubric-Guided RL, which enables stable reinforcement learning on open-ended scientific questions via rubric-based evaluation with explicit answer correctness. Qwen3-4B-Base trained using Dr. SCI pipeline achieves 63.2 on GPQA-diamond and 32.4 on GPQA-general, consistently improves over strong post-trained baselines such as o1-mini and GPT-4o, demonstrating substantial gains in scientific reasoning, especially in open-ended settings.",

      "title": "SoulX-Singer: Towards High-Quality Zero-Shot Singing Voice Synthesis",
      "abstract": "While recent years have witnessed rapid progress in speech synthesis, open-source singing voice synthesis (SVS) systems still face significant barriers to industrial deployment, particularly in terms of robustness and zero-shot generalization. In this report, we introduce SoulX-Singer, a high-quality open-source SVS system designed with practical deployment considerations in mind. SoulX-Singer supports controllable singing generation conditioned on either symbolic musical scores (MIDI) or melodic representations, enabling flexible and expressive control in real-world production workflows. Trained on more than 42,000 hours of vocal data, the system supports Mandarin Chinese, English, and Cantonese and consistently achieves state-of-the-art synthesis quality across languages under diverse musical conditions. Furthermore, to enable reliable evaluation of zero-shot SVS performance in practical scenarios, we construct SoulX-Singer-Eval, a dedicated benchmark with strict training-test disentanglement, facilitating systematic assessment in zero-shot settings.",

And the decisions they inform — which model to deploy, which research direction to fund, which tool to ship — may not be supported by the evidence. We found that SWE-Bench-Verified scores can vary by 2.2 to 6.0 percentage points, making small improvements hard to distinguish from noise. Read more at: https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07150",

      "abstract": "Tokenization is a pivotal design choice for morphologically rich languages like Turkish, where productive agglutination strains both vocabulary efficiency and morphological fidelity. Despite growing interest, prior work often varies vocabulary size without controlling the tokenizer’s training corpus, offers sparse intrinsic diagnostics, and tests a narrow band of downstream tasks. We present the first comprehensive, principled study of Turkish subword tokenization—a “subwords manifest”—that jointly varies vocabulary and corpus size, compares multiple tokenizer families under matched budgets (WordPiece, morphology‑level, and character baselines), and evaluates broadly across semantic, syntactic, and morphology‑sensitive probes. To explain why tokenizers succeed or fail, we introduce a morphology‑aware diagnostic toolkit that moves beyond coarse aggregates to boundary‑level F1, lemma atomicity vs. surface boundary hits, over/under‑segmentation indices, edit distances (CER/WER), continuation rates, and affix‑type coverage and atomicity. Our contributions deliver a systematic analysis of the vocabulary–corpus–success triad, a unified evaluation framework linking intrinsic diagnostics to extrinsic outcomes, controlled comparisons that identify when character‑ and morphology‑level tokenization pay off, and an open‑source release of code, pipelines, and models for reproducible research.",

      "abstract": "GraphAgents: Knowledge Graph-Guided Agentic AI for Cross-Domain Materials Design Large Language Models (LLMs) promise to accelerate discovery by reasoning across the expanding scientific landscape. Yet, the challenge is no longer access to information but connecting it in meaningful, domain-spanning ways. In materials science, where innovation demands integrating concepts from molecular chemistry to mechanical performance, this is especially acute. Neither humans nor single-agent LLMs can fully contend with this torrent of information, with the latter often prone to hallucinations. To address this bottleneck, we introduce a multi-agent framework guided by large-scale knowledge graphs to find sustainable substitutes for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS)-chemicals currently under intense regulatory scrutiny. Agents in the framework specialize in problem decomposition, evidence retrieval, design parameter extraction, and graph traversal, uncovering latent connections across distinct knowledge pockets to support hypothesis generation. Ablation studies show that the full multi-agent pipeline outperforms single-shot prompting, underscoring the value of distributed specialization and relational reasoning. We demonstrate that by tailoring graph traversal strategies, the system alternates between exploitative searches focusing on domain-critical outcomes and exploratory searches surfacing emergent cross-connections. Illustrated through the exemplar of biomedical tubing, the framework generates sustainable PFAS-free alternatives that balance tribological performance, thermal stability, chemical resistance, and biocompatibility. This work establishes a framework combining knowledge graphs with multi-agent reasoning to expand the materials design space, showcasing several initial design candidates to demonstrate the approach.",

To this end, Anchored Decoding is a decoding technique for language models (LMs) that provably reduces the likelihood of generating copyrighted text. It requires two LMs: a safe model trained exclusively on permissively licensed data, and a risky model that is higher-utility and trained on mixed-licensed data. Anchored Decoding works for both token-level and byte-level decoding. To make this algorithm as practical as possible, we release (1) TinyLlama 1.8B , a safe base LM that is tokenizer-compatible with the Llama 3 model family, and (2) byte-level support to facilitate mixed-tokenizer decoding.",

      "abstract": "Universal Multimodal Retrieval (UMR) seeks any-to-any search across text and vision, yet modern embedding models remain brittle when queries require latent reasoning (e.g., resolving underspecified references or matching compositional constraints). We argue this brittleness is often data-induced: when images carry \"silent\" evidence and queries leave key semantics implicit, a single embedding pass must both reason and compress, encouraging spurious feature matching. We propose a data-centric framework that decouples these roles by externalizing reasoning before retrieval. Using a strong Vision--Language Model, we make implicit semantics explicit by densely captioning visual evidence in corpus entries, resolving ambiguous multimodal references in queries, and rewriting verbose instructions into concise retrieval constraints. Inference-time enhancement alone is insufficient; the retriever must be trained on these semantically dense representations to avoid distribution shift and fully exploit the added signal. Across M-BEIR, our reasoning-augmented training method yields consistent gains over strong baselines, with ablations showing that corpus enhancement chiefly benefits knowledge-intensive queries while query enhancement is critical for compositional modification requests.",

Within this unified framework, we propose f-Group Relative Policy Optimization (f-GRPO), a class of on-policy re- inforcement learning, and f-Hybrid Alignment Loss (f-HAL), a hybrid on/off policy objectives, for general LLM alignment based on variational representation of f-divergences.

Our end-to-end formal infrastructure implement the missing contents in latest Lean library, including a complete development of Gaussian Lipschitz concentration, the first formalization of Dudley’s entropy integral theorem for sub-Gaussian processes, and an application to least-squares regression with a sharp rate. The project was carried out using a human–AI collaborative workflow, in which humans design proof strategies and AI agents execute tactical proof construction, resulting in approximately 30,000 lines of human-verified Lean 4 code produced over 500 hours of supervised development. Beyond implementation, the formalization process exposes and resolves implicit assumptions and missing details in standard SLT textbooks, enforcing a granular, line-by-line understanding of the theory.

      "title": "OPUS: Towards Efficient and Principled Data Selection in Large Language Model Pre-training in Every Iteration",
      "abstract": "In this paper, we argue that LLM pre-training is entering a “data-wall” regime where readily available high-quality public text is approaching exhaustion, so progress must shift from more tokens to better tokens chosen at the right time. While most existing pipelines either (i) apply static, training-agnostic quality filters or (ii) use dynamic selection criteria defined in raw gradient space, modern LLMs are actually trained with adaptive optimizers like AdamW or Muon whose preconditioning reshapes the effective update direction—creating a fundamental mismatch between “how we score data” and “how training truly updates the model.” To bridge this gap, we introduce OPUS (Optimizer-induced Projected Utility Selection), a dynamic selection framework that defines data utility directly in the optimizer-induced update space: a sample is valuable insofar as its optimizer-shaped effective update aligns with the descent direction of a stable, high-quality target distribution (our proxy). Concretely, OPUS operationalizes this idea through a principled objective, a scalable estimator, and a diversity-preserving selection rule. Our key contributions are: (1) an optimizer-aware utility for dynamic selection, with closed-form approximations for effective update directions under AdamW and Muon, aligning scoring with real training geometry; (2) BENCH-PROXY, an in-distribution proxy construction method that retrieves benchmark-aligned samples from the pre-training corpus to stabilize the target direction; (3) scalable utility estimation using the Ghost technique + CountSketch projections to avoid per-sample gradient materialization; and (4) Boltzmann sampling with redundancy control to prevent diversity collapse under non-stationary streams. Empirically, OPUS delivers strong data/compute efficiency: it reports only ~4.7% additional compute overhead for selection while achieving large gains across datasets, optimizers, and scales—including improved accuracy (+2.2% average over 10 benchmarks and 8× compute reduction in one highlighted setting), outperforming industrial static/dynamic baselines and even matching or exceeding much longer-token training in several regimes.",

      "abstract": "In this paper we propose a new interpretability method LatentLens. With this we can finally show that visual tokens are actually interpretable across all layers in an LLM, something that past methods like logit lens and or using the LLM's embedding matrix would not be able to do. Our key insight is to use a large pool of contextual embeddings from the LLM to find nearest neighbors instead of just using a static embedding or unembedding matrix: We empirically show how well LatentLens works in a controlled setting with 9 model combinations as well as an off-the-shelf VLM. We also notice that the Mid-Layer Leap phenomenon: visual tokens as they arrive at the LLM input are already most aligned to later semantic LLM layers! So for example a visual token arriving at layer 0 (coming from the vision encoder --> MLP), will have its closest nearest neighbors from e.g. layer 8 of the LLM. We hope this will spark new VLM interpretability research and even projects on other kinds of latent representations in LLM (soft prompts, speech, VLAs, ...)!",

To tackle long-horizon tasks and semantic generalization, we formulate language-conditioned action learning as a long-sequence interleaved planning problem. These modalities are structured into a unified sequence, enabling the model to generate predictions across all three modalities based on the interleaved context. To address the high latency in combining visual generation with control, we introduce Residual Flow Guidance (RFG). Instead of generating future frames from scratch, RFG conditions on the current observation as a strong structural prior and performs single-step denoising to predict the residual change toward the next keyframe. RFG provides a lightweight predictive visual representation that captures task-relevant dynamics with minimal overhead. This substantially reduces the computational cost of foresight while preserving its utility for action generation.",

      "abstract": "The prevalent paradigm in robot learning attempts to generalize across environments, embodiments, and tasks with language prompts at runtime. A fundamental tension limits this approach: language is often too abstract to guide the concrete physical understanding required for robust manipulation. In this work, we introduce Contact-Anchored Policies (CAP), a new class of general robotic behavior models, which replace language conditioning with points of physical contact in space. Simultaneously, we structure CAP as a library of modular utility models rather than a monolithic generalist policy. This factorization allows us to implement an efficient real-to-sim iteration cycle: we build EgoGym, a lightweight simulation benchmark, to rapidly identify failure modes and refine our models and datasets prior to real-world deployment. We show that by conditioning on contact and iterating via simulation, CAP generalizes to novel environments and embodiments out of the box on three fundamental manipulation skills while using only 23 hours of demonstration data, and outperforms large, state-of-the-art VLAs in zero-shot evaluations by 56%. All model checkpoints, codebase, hardware, simulation, and datasets will be open-sourced.",

Just like a child learns to fold a paper airplane or build a LEGO from video tutorials👶 😎Thrilled to introduce VideoWorld 2, the successor of VideoWorld. Unlike Sora and Veo, it is the the first generative model that masters complex real-world knowledge solely through visual data, without any reliance on language models. 🙋 You might wonder: what knowledge remains out of reach for today’s AI?  Try asking Sora 2 or Veo 3 to fold a coherent paper boat, or have Gemini describe every micro-fold and material change in text.  Although any child can master this skill just by watching video tutorials, today's most advanced AI often fails at such tasks. 🚀To address this challenge, we propose VideoWorld 2. Unlike models that rely on language priors, it is the first to master complex, long-horizon real-world knowledge solely by \"watching\" raw videos and  generalizing the skill to new environments. 🧑‍🏫 The \"Cambrian Moment\" for AI? As Dr. Feifei Li noted, vision-enabled perception and planning triggered the Cambrian Explosion 540 million years ago. VideoWorld 2 explores this frontier:  Without any textual descriptions, it completes minute-long handcraft tasks like paper folding and block-building, which involve fine-grained manipulation and long-horizon planning that current AI fails to learn. Furthermore, it can generalize these skills across various unseen scenes and perform multi-task, cross-environment robotic manipulation. Our main contributions are: 👉We explore, for the first time, how to learn complex, long-range skills from raw videos and generalize them to new environments. We find that disentangling visual appearance from core dynamics is the key to mastering world knowledge. 👉We propose VideoWorld 2, leveraging a dynamic-enhanced Latent Dynamic Model to extract task-relevant dynamics to boost long-horizon tasks success rates by up to 70% 👉We construct Video-CraftBench, a large-scale video-based handcraft dataset for training and evaluation, facilitating future research on knowledge learning from pure videos.",

      "abstract": "Activation steering has emerged as a promising method for efficiently adapting large language models (LLMs) to downstream behaviors. However, most existing steering approaches identify and steer the model from a single static direction for each task or concept, which is inflexible under task variation and insufficient for complex tasks requiring multiple coordinated capabilities. To address this gap, we propose Steer2Adapt, a lightweight framework that enables efficient LLM adaptation by composing steering vectors rather than learning new ones from scratch. In practice, tasks within the same domain (e.g., reasoning or safety) often share a small set of underlying concept dimensions. Steer2Adapt spans these dimensions into a reusable, low-dimensional semantic prior subspace and adapts to new tasks by dynamically discovering a linear combination of basis vectors using only a handful of examples. Experiments across 9 tasks and 3 models in both reasoning and safety domains demonstrate the effectiveness of Steer2Adapt, with an average of 8.2% improvement. Together with our analyses, we establish Steer2Adapt as a data-efficient, stable, and transparent inference-time adaptation method for LLMs.",

      "abstract": "Let's discuss Self-Feedback for RL Reasoning (iGRPO) Motivation. Current RL methods for reasoning (GRPO, DAPO, etc.) treat each generation as a one-shot attempt. The model samples, gets a reward, updates, and moves on. But humans almost never solve hard problems in one pass. We draft, re-read, spot mistakes, and refine. Existing RL pipelines don't capture this loop. Some recent methods try to close the gap with critique generation or self-verification, but these ask the model to learn auxiliary behaviors (writing critiques, producing verification rationales) that are only indirectly tied to the actual outcome reward. We wanted something simpler: what if the model's own best attempt is the feedback, and we just train it to beat that attempt? What we built. iGRPO is a two-stage extension of GRPO that adds self-conditioning through the model's own drafts. Stage 1 (Exploratory Draft Generation): Sample multiple candidate solutions from the current policy. Score them with the same scalar reward you're already using. Pick the best one. Stage 2 (Conditioned Refinement): Append that best draft to the original prompt and sample a new group of completions. Apply the standard GRPO-style clipped surrogate update only on these Stage 2 outputs. No critic networks, no reward models, no verification rationales, no generated critiques. The best draft is the only feedback signal, and it comes for free from Stage 1 exploration. The important part: as the policy improves across training, its Stage 1 drafts get stronger, so Stage 2 sees better conditioning, so the policy improves even more. We formally prove this monotonic improvement property under binary rewards: the expected quality of the selected draft increases as the policy's success probability increases. The model doesn't learn to copy the draft. It learns a refinement function that compounds across training. How it differs from critique/verification approaches. Methods like Self-Verification and Critique-GRPO require the model to produce extra text (verification steps, natural-language critiques) and then condition on that. This means the model has to allocate capacity to an auxiliary skill that isn't directly optimized by the outcome reward. iGRPO sidesteps this entirely. The conditioning signal is a full solution attempt scored by the same reward used for optimization. There's no ambiguity about what \"good feedback\" looks like, because it's literally the model's highest-reward output. Key results. Controlled comparisons (matched rollout budgets, same total completions per prompt): Nemotron-H-8B-Base-8K: iGRPO reaches 45.04% average vs. 41.08% for GRPO (+3.96), and beats Self-Verification (42.86%) and Critique-GRPO (43.39%). DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B: iGRPO at 69.87% vs. GRPO at 68.29%, with gains concentrated on multi-step benchmarks like AIME24 (56.30%) and AMC (95.00%). OpenMath-Nemotron-7B: Even with an already strong 74.83% base, iGRPO pushes to 76.07%. At 14B scale, gains persist: DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-14B goes from 71.29% (GRPO) to 73.02% (iGRPO); OpenMath-Nemotron-14B from 76.73% to 78.00%. Stronger base + harder data: OpenReasoning-Nemotron-7B trained on AceReason-Math with iGRPO achieves 85.62% on AIME24 and 79.64% on AIME25, with transfer gains on GPQA (+1.84) and MMLU-Pro (+0.91). The refinement wrapper generalizes beyond GRPO: Applying the same two-stage mechanism to DAPO and GSPO yields +1.19 and +1.11 average improvements respectively, under matched budgets. The gains come from the refinement interface, not GRPO-specific details. Richer rewards help: Swapping the binary outcome checker for a GPT-5 generative judge improves the average from 69.87% to 70.81% (+0.94), with the largest lifts on AIME24/25 and Minerva, consistent with partial credit keeping near-miss traces alive through Stage 1 selection. Learning dynamics: iGRPO delays premature entropy collapse. Both methods start at ~2.45 nats, but GRPO drops to 0.60 by 10% of training while iGRPO decays more gradually (0.80 at 15%). This sustained mid-training exploration lets the model recover from near-miss reasoning traces before converging. Overhead: Peak memory is essentially identical (~54.93 GB for both). Throughput drops from 0.41 to 0.34 samples/sec. Total training time increases by ~13% (83.3 → 94.1 GPU hours). No extra GPUs, no extra memory. In short, iGRPO adds a self-feedback refinement loop to group-based RL that uses the model's own best draft as conditioning. It's simple, adds minimal overhead, generalizes across optimizers, and consistently improves reasoning across model families and scales.",

We present a trajectory expansion framework Anchor that bootstraps scalable desktop supervision from a small set of verified seed demonstrations. Starting from each seed, we identify branch points that correspond to meaningful state changes and propose new, state-grounded task variants conditioned on the current GUI context. An executing agent then follows the proposed instructions to generate new trajectories, while a verifier enforces task completion via state-aware checks and trajectory-level consistency. To improve supervision quality, we further apply task-conditioned step-level filtering to remove ungrounded actions and denoise post-branch segments to maintain coherent intent. Experiments on standard desktop benchmarks, OSWorld and WindowsAgentArena, show that models fine-tuned on our expanded corpus achieve consistent improvements over zero-shot agents and representative synthesis baselines, and generalize across applications and operating systems.",

      "abstract": "Parallel thinking has emerged as a new paradigm for large reasoning models (LRMs) in tackling complex problems. Recent methods leverage Reinforcement Learning (RL) to enhance parallel thinking, aiming to address the limitations in computational resources and effectiveness encountered with supervised fine-tuning. However, most existing studies primarily focus on optimizing the aggregation phase, with limited attention to the path exploration stage. In this paper, we theoretically analyze the optimization of parallel thinking under the Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) setting, and identify that the mutual information bottleneck among exploration paths fundamentally restricts overall performance. To address this, we propose Outline-Guided Path Exploration (OPE) , which explicitly partitions the solution space by generating diverse reasoning outlines prior to parallel path reasoning, thereby reducing information redundancy and improving the diversity of information captured across exploration paths. We implement OPE with an iterative RL strategy that optimizes outline planning and outline-guided reasoning independently. Extensive experiments across multiple challenging mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that OPE effectively improves reasoning performance in different aggregation strategies, enabling LRMs to more reliably discover correct solutions.",

To address this limitation, we introduce TodoEvolve, a meta-planning paradigm that autonomously synthesizes and dynamically revises task-specific planning architectures. Specifically, we first construct PlanFactory, a modular design space that standardizes diverse planning paradigms within a unified codebase encompassing topology, initialization, adaptation, and navigation, thereby providing a common interface for heterogeneous planning patterns. Leveraging PlanFactory, we collect high-quality planning trajectories and train Todo-14B via \\textit{Impedance-Guided Preference Optimization} (IGPO), a multi-objective reinforcement learning objective that encourages the generation of planning systems that are performant, stable, and token-efficient across arbitrary tasks and agent backbones. Empirical evaluations on five agentic benchmarks demonstrate that TodoEvolve consistently surpasses carefully engineered planning modules while maintaining economical API costs and runtime overhead.",

Existing secure code alignment methods often suffer from a functionality–security paradox, improving security at the cost of substantial utility degradation. We propose SecCoderX, an online reinforcement learning framework for functionalitypreserving secure code generation. SecCoderX first bridges vulnerability detection and secure code generation by repurposing mature detection resources in two ways: (i) synthesizing diverse, reality grounded vulnerability-inducing coding tasks for online RL rollouts, and (ii) training a reasoning based vulnerability reward model that provides scalable and reliable security supervision. Together, these components are unified in an online RL loop to align code LLMs to generate secure and functional code. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SecCoderX achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving Effective Safety Rate (ESR) by approximately 10% over unaligned models, whereas prior methods often degrade ESR by 14-54%.

      "abstract": "While flow matching is elegant, its reliance on single-sample conditional velocities leads to high-variance training targets that destabilize optimization and slow convergence. By explicitly characterizing this variance, we identify 1) a high-variance regime near the prior, where optimization is challenging, and 2) a low-variance regime near the data distribution, where conditional and marginal velocities nearly coincide. Leveraging this insight, we propose Stable Velocity , a unified framework that improves both training and sampling. For training, we introduce Stable Velocity Matching (StableVM), an unbiased variance-reduction objective, along with Variance-Aware Representation Alignment (VA-REPA), which adaptively strengthen auxiliary supervision in the low-variance regime. For inference, we show that dynamics in the low-variance regime admit closed-form simplifications, enabling Stable Velocity Sampling (StableVS), a finetuning-free acceleration. Extensive experiments on ImageNet $256\\times256$ and large pretrained text-to-image and text-to-video models, including SD3.5, Flux, Qwen-Image, and Wan2.2, demonstrate consistent improvements in training efficiency and more than $2\\times$ faster sampling within the low-variance regime without degrading sample quality.",

In this work, we leverage Mixture of Factor Analyzers (MFA) as a scalable, unsupervised alternative that models the activation space as a collection of Gaussian regions with their local covariance structure. MFA decomposes activations into two compositional geometric objects: the region's centroid in activation space, and the local variation from the centroid. We train large-scale MFAs for Llama-3.1-8B and Gemma-2-2B, and show they capture complex, nonlinear structures in activation space. Moreover, evaluations on localization and steering benchmarks show that MFA outperforms unsupervised baselines, is competitive with supervised localization methods, and often achieves stronger steering performance than sparse autoencoders. Together, our findings position local geometry, expressed through subspaces, as a promising unit of analysis for scalable concept discovery and model control, accounting for complex structures that isolated directions fail to capture.",

However, standard diffusion transformers fail to converge on these representations directly. While recent work attributes this to a capacity bottleneck proposing computationally expensive width scaling of diffusion transformers we demonstrate that the failure is fundamentally geometric. We identify Geometric Interference as the root cause: standard Euclidean flow matching forces probability paths through the low-density interior of the hyperspherical feature space of representation encoders, rather than following the manifold surface. To resolve this, we propose Riemannian Flow Matching with Jacobi Regularization (RJF). By constraining the generative process to the manifold geodesics and correcting for curvature-induced error propagation, RJF enables standard Diffusion Transformer architectures to converge without width scaling. Our method RJF enables the standard DiT-B architecture (131M parameters) to converge effectively, achieving an FID of 3.37 where prior methods fail to converge.",

I tested the opposite on GPU kernel optimization and found that selecting by surprisal (the model's least confident correct solution) achieves 80% success vs 50% for confidence-guided, with a 3.5x mean speedup advantage. Evaluating just the top 3 by surprisal matches oracle performance at 100%. The key insight: a model's probability distribution maps frequency, not quality. Expert-level CUDA kernels are rare in training data, so the model assigns them low probability despite high performance. That signal is already in the logprobs at zero additional inference cost. I also find that test-time training (gradient adaptation) is worse than random on dense-reward tasks. TTT's best checkpoint (30.6%) falls below a single random sample (53.3%).

      "abstract": "Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved impressive performance in cross-modal understanding across textual and visual inputs, yet existing benchmarks predominantly focus on pure-text queries. In real-world scenarios, language also frequently appears as visualized text embedded in images, raising the question of whether current VLMs handle such input requests comparably. We introduce VISTA-Bench, a systematic benchmark from multimodal perception, reasoning, to unimodal understanding domains. It evaluates visualized text understanding by contrasting pure-text and visualized-text questions under controlled rendering conditions. Extensive evaluation of over 20 representative VLMs reveals a pronounced modality gap: models that perform well on pure-text queries often degrade substantially when equivalent semantic content is presented as visualized text. This gap is further amplified by increased perceptual difficulty, highlighting sensitivity to rendering variations despite unchanged semantics. Overall, VISTA-Bench provides a principled evaluation framework to diagnose this limitation and to guide progress toward more unified language representations across tokenized text and pixels.

      "title": "SafePred: A Predictive Guardrail for Computer-Using Agents via World Models",
      "abstract": "With the widespread deployment of Computer-using Agents (CUAs) in complex real-world environments, prevalent long-term risks often lead to severe and irreversible consequences. Most existing guardrails for CUAs adopt a reactive approach, constraining agent behavior only within the current observation space. While these guardrails can prevent immediate short-term risks (e.g., clicking on a phishing link), they cannot proactively avoid long-term risks: seemingly reasonable actions can lead to high-risk consequences that emerge with a delay (e.g., cleaning logs leads to future audits being untraceable), which reactive guardrails cannot identify within the current observation space. To address these limitations, we propose a predictive guardrail approach, with the core idea of aligning predicted future risks with current decisions. Based on this approach, we present SafePred, a predictive guardrail framework for CUAs that establishes a risk-to-decision loop to ensure safe agent behavior. SafePred supports two key abilities: (1) Short- and long-term risk prediction: by using safety policies as the basis for risk prediction, SafePred leverages the prediction capability of the world model to generate semantic representations of both short-term and long-term risks, thereby identifying and pruning actions that lead to high-risk states; (2) Decision optimization: translating predicted risks into actionable safe decision guidances through step-level interventions and task-level re-planning. Extensive experiments show that SafePred significantly reduces high-risk behaviors, achieving over 97.6% safety performance and improving task utility by up to 21.4% compared with reactive baselines.",

      "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-stakes domains, where rare but severe failures can result in irreversible harm. However, prevailing evaluation benchmarks often reduce complex social risk to mean-centered scalar scores, thereby obscuring distributional structure, cross-dimensional interactions, and worst-case behavior. This paper introduces Social Harm Analysis via Risk Profiles (SHARP), a framework for multidimensional, distribution-aware evaluation of social harm. SHARP models harm as a multivariate random variable and integrates explicit decomposition into bias, fairness, ethics, and epistemic reliability with a union-of-failures aggregation reparameterized as additive cumulative log-risk. The framework further employs risk-sensitive distributional statistics, with Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR95) as a primary metric, to characterize worst-case model behavior. Application of SHARP to eleven frontier LLMs, evaluated on a fixed corpus of n=901 socially sensitive prompts, reveals that models with similar average risk can exhibit more than twofold differences in tail exposure and volatility. Across models, dimension-wise marginal tail behavior varies systematically across harm dimensions, with bias exhibiting the strongest tail severities, epistemic and fairness risks occupying intermediate regimes, and ethical misalignment consistently lower; together, these patterns reveal heterogeneous, model-dependent failure structures that scalar benchmarks conflate. These findings indicate that responsible evaluation and governance of LLMs require moving beyond scalar averages toward multidimensional, tail-sensitive risk profiling.",
