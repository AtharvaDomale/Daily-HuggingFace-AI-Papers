      "abstract": "Most Large Language Model (LLM) agent memory systems rely on a small set of static, hand-designed operations for extracting memory. These fixed procedures hard-code human priors about what to store and how to revise memory, making them rigid under diverse interaction patterns and inefficient on long histories. To this end, we present \\textbf{MemSkill}, which reframes these operations as learnable and evolvable memory skills, structured and reusable routines for extracting, consolidating, and pruning information from interaction traces. Inspired by the design philosophy of agent skills, MemSkill employs a \\emph{controller} that learns to select a small set of relevant skills, paired with an LLM-based \\emph{executor} that produces skill-guided memories. Beyond learning skill selection, MemSkill introduces a \\emph{designer} that periodically reviews hard cases where selected skills yield incorrect or incomplete memories, and evolves the skill set by proposing refinements and new skills. Together, MemSkill forms a closed-loop procedure that improves both the skill-selection policy and the skill set itself. Experiments on LoCoMo, LongMemEval, HotpotQA, and ALFWorld demonstrate that MemSkill improves task performance over strong baselines and generalizes well across settings. Further analyses shed light on how skills evolve, offering insights toward more adaptive, self-evolving memory management for LLM agents.

      "abstract": "High-quality kernel is critical for scalable AI systems, and enabling LLMs to generate such code would advance AI development. However, training LLMs for this task requires sufficient data, a robust environment, and the process is often vulnerable to reward hacking and lazy optimization. In these cases, models may hack training rewards and prioritize trivial correctness over meaningful speedup. In this paper, we systematically study reinforcement learning (RL) for kernel generation. We first design KernelGYM, a robust distributed GPU environment that supports reward hacking check, data collection from multi-turn interactions and long-term RL training. Building on KernelGYM , we investigate effective multi-turn RL methods and identify a biased policy gradient issue caused by self-inclusion in GRPO. To solve this, we propose Turn-level Reinforce-Leave-One-Out ( TRLOO ) to provide unbiased advantage estimation for multi-turn RL. To alleviate lazy optimization, we incorporate mismatch correction for training stability and introduce Profiling-based Rewards ( PR ) and Profiling-based Rejection Sampling ( PRS ) to overcome the issue. The trained model, this Dr. Kernel-14B, reaches performance competitive with Claude-4.5-Sonnet in Kernelbench. Finally, we study sequential test-time scaling for this Dr. Kernel-14B. On the KernelBench Level-2 subset, 31.6% of the generated kernels achieve at least a 1.2x speedup over the Torch reference, surpassing Claude-4.5-Sonnet (26.7%) and GPT-5 (28.6%). When selecting the best candidate across all turns, this 1.2x speedup rate further increases to 47.8%.

      "abstract": "Training-time privileged information (PI) can enable language models to succeed on tasks they would otherwise fail, making it a powerful tool for reinforcement learning in hard, long-horizon settings. However, transferring capabilities learned with PI to policies that must act without it at inference time remains a fundamental challenge. We study this problem in the context of distilling frontier models for multi-turn agentic environments, where closed-source systems typically hide their internal reasoning and expose only action trajectories. This breaks standard distillation pipelines, since successful behavior is observable but the reasoning process is not. For this, we introduce {\\pi}-Distill, a joint teacher-student objective that trains a PI-conditioned teacher and an unconditioned student simultaneously using the same model. Additionally, we also introduce On-Policy Self-Distillation (OPSD), an alternative approach that trains using Reinforcement Learning (RL) with a reverse KL-penalty between the student and the PI-conditioned teacher. We show that both of these algorithms effectively distill frontier agents using action-only PI. Specifically we find that {\\pi}-Distill and in some cases OPSD, outperform industry standard practices (Supervised finetuning followed by RL) that assume access to full Chain-of-Thought supervision across multiple agentic benchmarks, models, and forms of PI. We complement our results with extensive analysis that characterizes the factors enabling effective learning with PI, focusing primarily on {\\pi}-Distill and characterizing when OPSD is competitive.",

However, in agentic settings, LLMs often struggle to anticipate action consequences and adapt to environment dynamics, highlighting the need for world-modeling capabilities in LLM-based agents. We propose Reinforcement World Model Learning (RWML), a self-supervised method that learns action-conditioned world models for LLM-based agents on textual states using sim-to-real gap rewards. Our method aligns simulated next states produced by the model with realized next states observed from the environment, encouraging consistency between internal world simulations and actual environment dynamics in a pre-trained embedding space. Unlike next-state token prediction, which prioritizes token-level fidelity (i.e., reproducing exact wording) over semantic equivalence and can lead to model collapse, our method provides a more robust training signal and is empirically less susceptible to reward hacking than LLM-as-a-judge. We evaluate our method on ALFWorld and τ2 Bench and observe significant gains over the base model, despite being entirely self-supervised. When combined with task-success rewards, our method outperforms direct task-success reward RL by 6.9 and 5.7 points on ALFWorld and τ2 Bench respectively, while matching the performance of expert-data training.",

      "abstract": "Despite strong performance on existing benchmarks, it remains unclear whether large language models can reason over genuinely novel scientific information. Most evaluations score end-to-end RAG pipelines, where reasoning is confounded with retrieval and toolchain choices, and the signal is further contaminated by parametric memorization and open-web volatility. We introduce DeR2, a controlled deep-research sandbox that isolates document-grounded reasoning while preserving core difficulties of deep search: multi-step synthesis, denoising, and evidence-based conclusion making. DeR2 decouples evidence access from reasoning via four regimes--Instruction-only, Concepts (gold concepts without documents), Related-only (only relevant documents), and Full-set (relevant documents plus topically related distractors)--yielding interpretable regime gaps that operationalize retrieval loss vs. reasoning loss and enable fine-grained error attribution. To prevent parametric leakage, we apply a two-phase validation that requires parametric failure without evidence while ensuring oracle-concept solvability. To ensure reproducibility, each instance provides a frozen document library (drawn from 2023-2025 theoretical papers) with expert-annotated concepts and validated rationales. Experiments across a diverse set of state-of-the-art foundation models reveal substantial variation and significant headroom: some models exhibit mode-switch fragility, performing worse with the Full-set than with Instruction-only, while others show structural concept misuse, correctly naming concepts but failing to execute them as procedures.",

While recent methods often rely on heuristic approaches to balance efficiency and quality, the fundamental relationship between original and synthetic data remains underexplored. This paper revisits knowledge distillation-based dataset distillation within a solid theoretical framework. We introduce the concepts of Informativeness and Utility, capturing crucial information within a sample and essential samples in the training set, respectively. Building on these principles, we define optimal dataset distillation mathematically. We then present InfoUtil, a framework that balances informativeness and utility in synthesizing the distilled dataset. InfoUtil incorporates two key components: (1) game-theoretic informativeness maximization using Shapley Value attribution to extract key information from samples, and (2) principled utility maximization by selecting globally influential samples based on Gradient Norm.

      "abstract": "As Large Language Models increasingly automate complex, long-horizon tasks such as \\emph{vibe coding}, a supervision gap has emerged. While models excel at execution, users often struggle to guide them effectively due to insufficient domain expertise, the difficulty of articulating precise intent, and the inability to reliably validate complex outputs. It presents a critical challenge in scalable oversight: enabling humans to responsibly steer AI systems on tasks that surpass their own ability to specify or verify. To tackle this, we propose Scalable Interactive Oversight, a framework that decomposes complex intent into a recursive tree of manageable decisions to amplify human supervision. Rather than relying on open-ended prompting, our system elicits low-burden feedback at each node and recursively aggregates these signals into precise global guidance. Validated in web development task, our framework enables non-experts to produce expert-level Product Requirement Documents, achieving a 54% improvement in alignment. Crucially, we demonstrate that this framework can be optimized via Reinforcement Learning using only online user feedback, offering a practical pathway for maintaining human control as AI scales.",

Meanwhile, LLM-based retrievers have demonstrated strong capability in following instructions or reasoning. This raises a critical question: can LLM-based retrievers effectively contribute to deep research agent workflows? To investigate this, we introduce SAGE, a benchmark for scientific literature retrieval comprising 1,200 queries across four scientific domains, with a 200,000-paper retrieval corpus. We evaluate six deep research agents and find that all systems struggle with reasoning-intensive retrieval. Using DR Tulu as backbone, we further compare BM25 and LLM-based retrievers (i.e. ReasonIR and gte-Qwen2-7B-instruct) as alternative search tools. Surprisingly, BM25 significantly outperforms LLM-based retrievers by approximately 30%, as existing agents generate keyword-oriented sub-queries. To improve performance, we propose a corpus-level test-time scaling framework that uses LLMs to augment documents with metadata and keywords, making retrieval easier for off-the-shelf retrievers. This yields 8% and 2% gains on short-form and open-ended questions, respectively.",

      "abstract": "We propose DASH ( D istributed A ccelerated SH ampoo), a faster and more accurate version of Distributed Shampoo. To make it faster, we stack the blocks extracted from the preconditioners to obtain a 3D tensor, which are inverted efficiently using batch-matmuls via iterative procedures. To make it more accurate, we introduce an existing iterative method from Numerical Linear Algebra called Newton-DB, which is more accurate than the existing Coupled Newton implemented in Distributed Shampoo. These iterative procedures usually require the largest eigen-value of the input matrix to be upper bounded by 1, which should be obtained by scaling the input matrix. In theory, one should divide by the true largest eigen-value of the matrix, which is expensive to compute in Distributed Shampoo. Before our work, the simplest scaling was Frobenius norm, which is usually much larger than the largest eigen-value. Since we work with all blocks in parallel in a stacked form, our implementation allows running Power-Iteration to estimate the largest eigen-value for all blocks in one shot. Why is this better? When we scale the input matrix by Frobenius norm, the spectrum is shifted towards zero. We show that iterative procedures require more steps to converge for small eigen-values compared to larger ones. Therefore, scaling by an approximation of the largest eigen-value is desired and in our DASH implementation this is cheaper and therefore leads to faster training and more accurate models.

However, existing approaches remain largely language-driven, relying on static visual encodings and lacking the ability to actively verify fine-grained visual evidence, which often leads to speculative reasoning in visually ambiguous cases. We propose V-Retrver, an evidence-driven retrieval framework that reformulates multimodal retrieval as an agentic reasoning process grounded in visual inspection. V-Retrver enables an MLLM to selectively acquire visual evidence during reasoning via external visual tools, performing a multimodal interleaved reasoning process that alternates between hypothesis generation and targeted visual verification.To train such an evidence-gathering retrieval agent, we adopt a curriculum-based learning strategy combining supervised reasoning activation, rejection-based refinement, and reinforcement learning with an evidence-aligned objective. Experiments across multiple multimodal retrieval benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements in retrieval accuracy (with 23.0% improvements on average), perception-driven reasoning reliability, and generalization.",

CatRAG introduces a context-aware traversal framework that transforms the static KG into a query-adaptive navigation structure. By integrating symbolic anchoring and dynamic edge weighting, the system effectively prunes irrelevant paths and amplifies those aligned with the query’s specific intent. A key finding of our work is that while standard recall metrics show modest gains, there is a significant improvement in \"reasoning completeness\"—the ability to recover the entire evidence chain without gaps. This shift from partial context retrieval to grounded reasoning paths is a necessary step for robust multi-hop RAG. We look forward to discussing the implications of dynamic graph steering and how these techniques might scale to increasingly large and heterogeneous knowledge structures.",

      "abstract": "Adaptive 1D Video Diffusion Autoencoder Recent video generation models largely rely on video autoencoders that compress pixel-space videos into latent representations. However, existing video autoencoders suffer from three major limitations: (1) fixed-rate compression that wastes tokens on simple videos, (2) inflexible CNN architectures that prevent variable-length latent modeling, and (3) deterministic decoders that struggle to recover appropriate details from compressed latents. To address these issues, we propose One-Dimensional Diffusion Video Autoencoder (One-DVA), a transformer-based framework for adaptive 1D encoding and diffusion-based decoding. The encoder employs query-based vision transformers to extract spatiotemporal features and produce latent representations, while a variable-length dropout mechanism dynamically adjusts the latent length. The decoder is a pixel-space diffusion transformer that reconstructs videos with the latents as input conditions. With a two-stage training strategy, One-DVA achieves performance comparable to 3D-CNN VAEs on reconstruction metrics at identical compression ratios. More importantly, it supports adaptive compression and thus can achieve higher compression ratios. To better support downstream latent generation, we further regularize the One-DVA latent distribution for generative modeling and fine-tune its decoder to mitigate artifacts caused by the generation process.",

We propose PhysicsAgentABM, which shifts inference to behaviorally coherent agent clusters: state-specialized symbolic agents encode mechanistic transition priors, a multimodal neural transition model captures temporal and interaction dynamics, and uncertainty-aware epistemic fusion yields calibrated cluster-level transition distributions. Individual agents then stochastically realize transitions under local constraints, decoupling population inference from entity-level variability. We further introduce ANCHOR, an LLM agent-driven clustering strategy based on cross-contextual behavioral responses and a novel contrastive loss, reducing LLM calls by up to 6-8 times. Experiments across public health, finance, and social sciences show consistent gains in event-time accuracy and calibration over mechanistic, neural, and LLM baselines. By re-architecting generative ABM around population-level inference with uncertainty-aware neuro-symbolic fusion, PhysicsAgentABM establishes a new paradigm for scalable and calibrated simulation with LLMs.",

      "abstract": "Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) deliver strong long-context processing capability in a non-autoregressive decoding paradigm. However, the considerable computational cost of bidirectional full attention limits the inference efficiency. Although sparse attention is promising, existing methods remain ineffective. This stems from the need to estimate attention importance for tokens yet to be decoded, while the unmasked token positions are unknown during diffusion. In this paper, we present Focus-dLLM, a novel training-free attention sparsification framework tailored for accurate and efficient long-context dLLM inference. Based on the finding that token confidence strongly correlates across adjacent steps, we first design a past confidence-guided indicator to predict unmasked regions. Built upon this, we propose a sink-aware pruning strategy to accurately estimate and remove redundant attention computation, while preserving highly influential attention sinks. To further reduce overhead, this strategy reuses identified sink locations across layers, leveraging the observed cross-layer consistency. Experimental results show that our method offers more than 29× lossless speedup under 32K context length.",

      "abstract": "Current Vision–Language–Action (VLA) models rely on fixed computational depth, expending the same amount of compute on simple adjustments and complex multi-step manipulation. While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting enables variable computation, it scales memory linearly and is ill-suited for continuous action spaces. We introduce Recurrent-Depth VLA (RD-VLA), an architecture that achieves computational adaptivity via latent iterative refinement rather than explicit token generation. RD-VLA employs a recurrent, weight-tied action head that supports arbitrary inference depth with a constant memory footprint. The model is trained using truncated backpropagation through time (TBPTT) to efficiently supervise the refinement process. At inference, RD-VLA dynamically allocates compute using an adaptive stopping criterion based on latent convergence. Experiments on challenging manipulation tasks show that recurrent depth is critical: tasks that fail entirely (0% success) with single-iteration inference exceed 90% success with four iterations, while simpler tasks saturate rapidly. RD-VLA provides a scalable path to test-time compute in robotics, replacing token-based reasoning with latent reasoning to achieve constant memory usage and up to 80× inference speedup over prior reasoning-based VLA models.",

      "abstract": "Deploying GRPO on Flow Matching models has proven effective for text-to-image generation. However, existing paradigms typically propagate an outcome-based reward to all preceding denoising steps without distinguishing the local effect of each step. Moreover, current group-wise ranking mainly compares trajectories at matched timesteps and ignores within-trajectory dependencies, where certain early denoising actions can affect later states via delayed, implicit interactions. We propose TurningPoint-GRPO (TP-GRPO), a GRPO framework that alleviates step-wise reward sparsity and explicitly models long-term effects within the denoising trajectory. TP-GRPO makes two key innovations: (i) it replaces outcome-based rewards with step-level incremental rewards, providing a dense, step-aware learning signal that better isolates each denoising action's \"pure\" effect, and (ii) it identifies turning points-steps that flip the local reward trend and make subsequent reward evolution consistent with the overall trajectory trend-and assigns these actions an aggregated long-term reward to capture their delayed impact. Turning points are detected solely via sign changes in incremental rewards, making TP-GRPO efficient and hyperparameter-free. Extensive experiments also demonstrate that TP-GRPO exploits reward signals more effectively and consistently improves generation.",

      "abstract": "Recent advancements in image generation models have enabled the prediction of future Graphical User Interface (GUI) states based on user instructions. However, existing benchmarks primarily focus on general domain visual fidelity, leaving the evaluation of state transitions and temporal coherence in GUI-specific contexts underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce GEBench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating dynamic interaction and temporal coherence in GUI generation. GEBench comprises 700 carefully curated samples spanning five task categories, covering both single-step interactions and multi-step trajectories across real-world and fictional scenarios, as well as grounding point localization. To support systematic evaluation, we propose GE-Score, a novel five-dimensional metric that assesses Goal Achievement, Interaction Logic, Content Consistency, UI Plausibility, and Visual Quality. Extensive evaluations on current models indicate that while they perform well on single-step transitions, they struggle significantly with maintaining temporal coherence and spatial grounding over longer interaction sequences. Our findings identify icon interpretation, text rendering, and localization precision as critical bottlenecks. This work provides a foundation for systematic assessment and suggests promising directions for future research toward building high-fidelity generative GUI environments.

      "abstract": "Memory is increasingly central to Large Language Model (LLM) agents operating beyond a single context window, yet most existing systems rely on offline, query-agnostic memory construction that can be inefficient and may discard query-critical information. Although runtime memory utilization is a natural alternative, prior work often incurs substantial overhead and offers limited explicit control over the performance-cost trade-off. In this work, we present BudgetMem, a runtime agent memory framework for explicit, query-aware performance-cost control. BudgetMem structures memory processing as a set of memory modules, each offered in three budget tiers (i.e., Low/Mid/High). A lightweight router performs budget-tier routing across modules to balance task performance and memory construction cost, which is implemented as a compact neural policy trained with reinforcement learning. Using BudgetMem as a unified testbed, we study three complementary strategies for realizing budget tiers: implementation (method complexity), reasoning (inference behavior), and capacity (module model size). Across LoCoMo, LongMemEval, and HotpotQA, BudgetMem surpasses strong baselines when performance is prioritized (i.e., high-budget setting), and delivers better accuracy-cost frontiers under tighter budgets. Moreover, our analysis disentangles the strengths and weaknesses of different tiering strategies, clarifying when each axis delivers the most favorable trade-offs under varying budget regimes.",

Data: We collected a new dataset of reasoning trajectories from symbolic tasks to focus purely on logic, stripping away the distraction of real-world knowledge. Method: We tested various ways to induce these skills intoLLMs, ranging from simple fine-tuning to more advanced structural changes like Mixture-of-Experts (MoE). Result: Focusing on these fundamental paradigms led to significant performance boosts (up to 14.60 points) when the models were tested on real-world, natural language tasks they hadn't seen before.",

To address the scarcity of high-fidelity training data and the distributional mismatch where models struggle to recover from their own mistakes, the framework employs two key phases: Environment Synthesis: It uses a multi-agent refinement loop to generate diverse, functionally valid tasks and verifiable Docker containers. Trajectory Collection: It utilizes a Generator-Critic protocol that actively injects errors into trajectories to teach models how to diagnose and recover from runtime failures. The resulting model, TermiGen-Qwen2.5-Coder-32B, achieves a state-of-the-art 31.3% pass rate on TerminalBench, outperforming existing open-source baselines and even surpassing proprietary models like GPT-4o-mini.",

      "abstract": "Solving open-ended science questions remains challenging for large language models, particularly due to inherently unreliable supervision and evaluation. The bottleneck lies in the data construction and reward design for scientific post-training. We develop a large-scale, systematic data processing pipeline that transforms heterogeneous open-source science data into Dr. SCI dataset, which comprises of 1M questions across eight STEM subjects, with explicit verifiable/open-ended splits, scalable difficulty annotation, and fine-grained rubrics that operationalize evaluation for open-ended answers. Building on this dataset, we propose the Dr. SCI post-training pipeline, which redesigns the standard SFT -> RL workflow through three components: (i) Exploration-Expanding SFT, which broadens the model's reasoning pattern coverage prior to RL; (ii) Dynamic Difficulty Curriculum, which adapts training data to the model's evolving scientific capability; and (iii) SciRubric-Guided RL, which enables stable reinforcement learning on open-ended scientific questions via rubric-based evaluation with explicit answer correctness. Qwen3-4B-Base trained using Dr. SCI pipeline achieves 63.2 on GPQA-diamond and 32.4 on GPQA-general, consistently improves over strong post-trained baselines such as o1-mini and GPT-4o, demonstrating substantial gains in scientific reasoning, especially in open-ended settings.",

      "title": "SoulX-Singer: Towards High-Quality Zero-Shot Singing Voice Synthesis",
      "abstract": "While recent years have witnessed rapid progress in speech synthesis, open-source singing voice synthesis (SVS) systems still face significant barriers to industrial deployment, particularly in terms of robustness and zero-shot generalization. In this report, we introduce SoulX-Singer, a high-quality open-source SVS system designed with practical deployment considerations in mind. SoulX-Singer supports controllable singing generation conditioned on either symbolic musical scores (MIDI) or melodic representations, enabling flexible and expressive control in real-world production workflows. Trained on more than 42,000 hours of vocal data, the system supports Mandarin Chinese, English, and Cantonese and consistently achieves state-of-the-art synthesis quality across languages under diverse musical conditions. Furthermore, to enable reliable evaluation of zero-shot SVS performance in practical scenarios, we construct SoulX-Singer-Eval, a dedicated benchmark with strict training-test disentanglement, facilitating systematic assessment in zero-shot settings.",

And the decisions they inform — which model to deploy, which research direction to fund, which tool to ship — may not be supported by the evidence. We found that SWE-Bench-Verified scores can vary by 2.2 to 6.0 percentage points, making small improvements hard to distinguish from noise. Read more at: https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07150",

      "abstract": "Tokenization is a pivotal design choice for morphologically rich languages like Turkish, where productive agglutination strains both vocabulary efficiency and morphological fidelity. Despite growing interest, prior work often varies vocabulary size without controlling the tokenizer’s training corpus, offers sparse intrinsic diagnostics, and tests a narrow band of downstream tasks. We present the first comprehensive, principled study of Turkish subword tokenization—a “subwords manifest”—that jointly varies vocabulary and corpus size, compares multiple tokenizer families under matched budgets (WordPiece, morphology‑level, and character baselines), and evaluates broadly across semantic, syntactic, and morphology‑sensitive probes. To explain why tokenizers succeed or fail, we introduce a morphology‑aware diagnostic toolkit that moves beyond coarse aggregates to boundary‑level F1, lemma atomicity vs. surface boundary hits, over/under‑segmentation indices, edit distances (CER/WER), continuation rates, and affix‑type coverage and atomicity. Our contributions deliver a systematic analysis of the vocabulary–corpus–success triad, a unified evaluation framework linking intrinsic diagnostics to extrinsic outcomes, controlled comparisons that identify when character‑ and morphology‑level tokenization pay off, and an open‑source release of code, pipelines, and models for reproducible research.",

      "abstract": "GraphAgents: Knowledge Graph-Guided Agentic AI for Cross-Domain Materials Design Large Language Models (LLMs) promise to accelerate discovery by reasoning across the expanding scientific landscape. Yet, the challenge is no longer access to information but connecting it in meaningful, domain-spanning ways. In materials science, where innovation demands integrating concepts from molecular chemistry to mechanical performance, this is especially acute. Neither humans nor single-agent LLMs can fully contend with this torrent of information, with the latter often prone to hallucinations. To address this bottleneck, we introduce a multi-agent framework guided by large-scale knowledge graphs to find sustainable substitutes for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS)-chemicals currently under intense regulatory scrutiny. Agents in the framework specialize in problem decomposition, evidence retrieval, design parameter extraction, and graph traversal, uncovering latent connections across distinct knowledge pockets to support hypothesis generation. Ablation studies show that the full multi-agent pipeline outperforms single-shot prompting, underscoring the value of distributed specialization and relational reasoning. We demonstrate that by tailoring graph traversal strategies, the system alternates between exploitative searches focusing on domain-critical outcomes and exploratory searches surfacing emergent cross-connections. Illustrated through the exemplar of biomedical tubing, the framework generates sustainable PFAS-free alternatives that balance tribological performance, thermal stability, chemical resistance, and biocompatibility. This work establishes a framework combining knowledge graphs with multi-agent reasoning to expand the materials design space, showcasing several initial design candidates to demonstrate the approach.",

To this end, Anchored Decoding is a decoding technique for language models (LMs) that provably reduces the likelihood of generating copyrighted text. It requires two LMs: a safe model trained exclusively on permissively licensed data, and a risky model that is higher-utility and trained on mixed-licensed data. Anchored Decoding works for both token-level and byte-level decoding. To make this algorithm as practical as possible, we release (1) TinyLlama 1.8B , a safe base LM that is tokenizer-compatible with the Llama 3 model family, and (2) byte-level support to facilitate mixed-tokenizer decoding.",

      "abstract": "Universal Multimodal Retrieval (UMR) seeks any-to-any search across text and vision, yet modern embedding models remain brittle when queries require latent reasoning (e.g., resolving underspecified references or matching compositional constraints). We argue this brittleness is often data-induced: when images carry \"silent\" evidence and queries leave key semantics implicit, a single embedding pass must both reason and compress, encouraging spurious feature matching. We propose a data-centric framework that decouples these roles by externalizing reasoning before retrieval. Using a strong Vision--Language Model, we make implicit semantics explicit by densely captioning visual evidence in corpus entries, resolving ambiguous multimodal references in queries, and rewriting verbose instructions into concise retrieval constraints. Inference-time enhancement alone is insufficient; the retriever must be trained on these semantically dense representations to avoid distribution shift and fully exploit the added signal. Across M-BEIR, our reasoning-augmented training method yields consistent gains over strong baselines, with ablations showing that corpus enhancement chiefly benefits knowledge-intensive queries while query enhancement is critical for compositional modification requests.",

Within this unified framework, we propose f-Group Relative Policy Optimization (f-GRPO), a class of on-policy re- inforcement learning, and f-Hybrid Alignment Loss (f-HAL), a hybrid on/off policy objectives, for general LLM alignment based on variational representation of f-divergences.

Our end-to-end formal infrastructure implement the missing contents in latest Lean library, including a complete development of Gaussian Lipschitz concentration, the first formalization of Dudley’s entropy integral theorem for sub-Gaussian processes, and an application to least-squares regression with a sharp rate. The project was carried out using a human–AI collaborative workflow, in which humans design proof strategies and AI agents execute tactical proof construction, resulting in approximately 30,000 lines of human-verified Lean 4 code produced over 500 hours of supervised development. Beyond implementation, the formalization process exposes and resolves implicit assumptions and missing details in standard SLT textbooks, enforcing a granular, line-by-line understanding of the theory.

      "title": "OPUS: Towards Efficient and Principled Data Selection in Large Language Model Pre-training in Every Iteration",
      "abstract": "In this paper, we argue that LLM pre-training is entering a “data-wall” regime where readily available high-quality public text is approaching exhaustion, so progress must shift from more tokens to better tokens chosen at the right time. While most existing pipelines either (i) apply static, training-agnostic quality filters or (ii) use dynamic selection criteria defined in raw gradient space, modern LLMs are actually trained with adaptive optimizers like AdamW or Muon whose preconditioning reshapes the effective update direction—creating a fundamental mismatch between “how we score data” and “how training truly updates the model.” To bridge this gap, we introduce OPUS (Optimizer-induced Projected Utility Selection), a dynamic selection framework that defines data utility directly in the optimizer-induced update space: a sample is valuable insofar as its optimizer-shaped effective update aligns with the descent direction of a stable, high-quality target distribution (our proxy). Concretely, OPUS operationalizes this idea through a principled objective, a scalable estimator, and a diversity-preserving selection rule. Our key contributions are: (1) an optimizer-aware utility for dynamic selection, with closed-form approximations for effective update directions under AdamW and Muon, aligning scoring with real training geometry; (2) BENCH-PROXY, an in-distribution proxy construction method that retrieves benchmark-aligned samples from the pre-training corpus to stabilize the target direction; (3) scalable utility estimation using the Ghost technique + CountSketch projections to avoid per-sample gradient materialization; and (4) Boltzmann sampling with redundancy control to prevent diversity collapse under non-stationary streams. Empirically, OPUS delivers strong data/compute efficiency: it reports only ~4.7% additional compute overhead for selection while achieving large gains across datasets, optimizers, and scales—including improved accuracy (+2.2% average over 10 benchmarks and 8× compute reduction in one highlighted setting), outperforming industrial static/dynamic baselines and even matching or exceeding much longer-token training in several regimes.",

      "abstract": "In this paper we propose a new interpretability method LatentLens. With this we can finally show that visual tokens are actually interpretable across all layers in an LLM, something that past methods like logit lens and or using the LLM's embedding matrix would not be able to do. Our key insight is to use a large pool of contextual embeddings from the LLM to find nearest neighbors instead of just using a static embedding or unembedding matrix: We empirically show how well LatentLens works in a controlled setting with 9 model combinations as well as an off-the-shelf VLM. We also notice that the Mid-Layer Leap phenomenon: visual tokens as they arrive at the LLM input are already most aligned to later semantic LLM layers! So for example a visual token arriving at layer 0 (coming from the vision encoder --> MLP), will have its closest nearest neighbors from e.g. layer 8 of the LLM. We hope this will spark new VLM interpretability research and even projects on other kinds of latent representations in LLM (soft prompts, speech, VLAs, ...)!",

To tackle long-horizon tasks and semantic generalization, we formulate language-conditioned action learning as a long-sequence interleaved planning problem. These modalities are structured into a unified sequence, enabling the model to generate predictions across all three modalities based on the interleaved context. To address the high latency in combining visual generation with control, we introduce Residual Flow Guidance (RFG). Instead of generating future frames from scratch, RFG conditions on the current observation as a strong structural prior and performs single-step denoising to predict the residual change toward the next keyframe. RFG provides a lightweight predictive visual representation that captures task-relevant dynamics with minimal overhead. This substantially reduces the computational cost of foresight while preserving its utility for action generation.",

      "abstract": "The prevalent paradigm in robot learning attempts to generalize across environments, embodiments, and tasks with language prompts at runtime. A fundamental tension limits this approach: language is often too abstract to guide the concrete physical understanding required for robust manipulation. In this work, we introduce Contact-Anchored Policies (CAP), a new class of general robotic behavior models, which replace language conditioning with points of physical contact in space. Simultaneously, we structure CAP as a library of modular utility models rather than a monolithic generalist policy. This factorization allows us to implement an efficient real-to-sim iteration cycle: we build EgoGym, a lightweight simulation benchmark, to rapidly identify failure modes and refine our models and datasets prior to real-world deployment. We show that by conditioning on contact and iterating via simulation, CAP generalizes to novel environments and embodiments out of the box on three fundamental manipulation skills while using only 23 hours of demonstration data, and outperforms large, state-of-the-art VLAs in zero-shot evaluations by 56%. All model checkpoints, codebase, hardware, simulation, and datasets will be open-sourced.",

Just like a child learns to fold a paper airplane or build a LEGO from video tutorials👶 😎Thrilled to introduce VideoWorld 2, the successor of VideoWorld. Unlike Sora and Veo, it is the the first generative model that masters complex real-world knowledge solely through visual data, without any reliance on language models. 🙋 You might wonder: what knowledge remains out of reach for today’s AI?  Try asking Sora 2 or Veo 3 to fold a coherent paper boat, or have Gemini describe every micro-fold and material change in text.  Although any child can master this skill just by watching video tutorials, today's most advanced AI often fails at such tasks. 🚀To address this challenge, we propose VideoWorld 2. Unlike models that rely on language priors, it is the first to master complex, long-horizon real-world knowledge solely by \"watching\" raw videos and  generalizing the skill to new environments. 🧑‍🏫 The \"Cambrian Moment\" for AI? As Dr. Feifei Li noted, vision-enabled perception and planning triggered the Cambrian Explosion 540 million years ago. VideoWorld 2 explores this frontier:  Without any textual descriptions, it completes minute-long handcraft tasks like paper folding and block-building, which involve fine-grained manipulation and long-horizon planning that current AI fails to learn. Furthermore, it can generalize these skills across various unseen scenes and perform multi-task, cross-environment robotic manipulation. Our main contributions are: 👉We explore, for the first time, how to learn complex, long-range skills from raw videos and generalize them to new environments. We find that disentangling visual appearance from core dynamics is the key to mastering world knowledge. 👉We propose VideoWorld 2, leveraging a dynamic-enhanced Latent Dynamic Model to extract task-relevant dynamics to boost long-horizon tasks success rates by up to 70% 👉We construct Video-CraftBench, a large-scale video-based handcraft dataset for training and evaluation, facilitating future research on knowledge learning from pure videos.",

      "abstract": "Activation steering has emerged as a promising method for efficiently adapting large language models (LLMs) to downstream behaviors. However, most existing steering approaches identify and steer the model from a single static direction for each task or concept, which is inflexible under task variation and insufficient for complex tasks requiring multiple coordinated capabilities. To address this gap, we propose Steer2Adapt, a lightweight framework that enables efficient LLM adaptation by composing steering vectors rather than learning new ones from scratch. In practice, tasks within the same domain (e.g., reasoning or safety) often share a small set of underlying concept dimensions. Steer2Adapt spans these dimensions into a reusable, low-dimensional semantic prior subspace and adapts to new tasks by dynamically discovering a linear combination of basis vectors using only a handful of examples. Experiments across 9 tasks and 3 models in both reasoning and safety domains demonstrate the effectiveness of Steer2Adapt, with an average of 8.2% improvement. Together with our analyses, we establish Steer2Adapt as a data-efficient, stable, and transparent inference-time adaptation method for LLMs.",

      "abstract": "Let's discuss Self-Feedback for RL Reasoning (iGRPO) Motivation. Current RL methods for reasoning (GRPO, DAPO, etc.) treat each generation as a one-shot attempt. The model samples, gets a reward, updates, and moves on. But humans almost never solve hard problems in one pass. We draft, re-read, spot mistakes, and refine. Existing RL pipelines don't capture this loop. Some recent methods try to close the gap with critique generation or self-verification, but these ask the model to learn auxiliary behaviors (writing critiques, producing verification rationales) that are only indirectly tied to the actual outcome reward. We wanted something simpler: what if the model's own best attempt is the feedback, and we just train it to beat that attempt? What we built. iGRPO is a two-stage extension of GRPO that adds self-conditioning through the model's own drafts. Stage 1 (Exploratory Draft Generation): Sample multiple candidate solutions from the current policy. Score them with the same scalar reward you're already using. Pick the best one. Stage 2 (Conditioned Refinement): Append that best draft to the original prompt and sample a new group of completions. Apply the standard GRPO-style clipped surrogate update only on these Stage 2 outputs. No critic networks, no reward models, no verification rationales, no generated critiques. The best draft is the only feedback signal, and it comes for free from Stage 1 exploration. The important part: as the policy improves across training, its Stage 1 drafts get stronger, so Stage 2 sees better conditioning, so the policy improves even more. We formally prove this monotonic improvement property under binary rewards: the expected quality of the selected draft increases as the policy's success probability increases. The model doesn't learn to copy the draft. It learns a refinement function that compounds across training. How it differs from critique/verification approaches. Methods like Self-Verification and Critique-GRPO require the model to produce extra text (verification steps, natural-language critiques) and then condition on that. This means the model has to allocate capacity to an auxiliary skill that isn't directly optimized by the outcome reward. iGRPO sidesteps this entirely. The conditioning signal is a full solution attempt scored by the same reward used for optimization. There's no ambiguity about what \"good feedback\" looks like, because it's literally the model's highest-reward output. Key results. Controlled comparisons (matched rollout budgets, same total completions per prompt): Nemotron-H-8B-Base-8K: iGRPO reaches 45.04% average vs. 41.08% for GRPO (+3.96), and beats Self-Verification (42.86%) and Critique-GRPO (43.39%). DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B: iGRPO at 69.87% vs. GRPO at 68.29%, with gains concentrated on multi-step benchmarks like AIME24 (56.30%) and AMC (95.00%). OpenMath-Nemotron-7B: Even with an already strong 74.83% base, iGRPO pushes to 76.07%. At 14B scale, gains persist: DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-14B goes from 71.29% (GRPO) to 73.02% (iGRPO); OpenMath-Nemotron-14B from 76.73% to 78.00%. Stronger base + harder data: OpenReasoning-Nemotron-7B trained on AceReason-Math with iGRPO achieves 85.62% on AIME24 and 79.64% on AIME25, with transfer gains on GPQA (+1.84) and MMLU-Pro (+0.91). The refinement wrapper generalizes beyond GRPO: Applying the same two-stage mechanism to DAPO and GSPO yields +1.19 and +1.11 average improvements respectively, under matched budgets. The gains come from the refinement interface, not GRPO-specific details. Richer rewards help: Swapping the binary outcome checker for a GPT-5 generative judge improves the average from 69.87% to 70.81% (+0.94), with the largest lifts on AIME24/25 and Minerva, consistent with partial credit keeping near-miss traces alive through Stage 1 selection. Learning dynamics: iGRPO delays premature entropy collapse. Both methods start at ~2.45 nats, but GRPO drops to 0.60 by 10% of training while iGRPO decays more gradually (0.80 at 15%). This sustained mid-training exploration lets the model recover from near-miss reasoning traces before converging. Overhead: Peak memory is essentially identical (~54.93 GB for both). Throughput drops from 0.41 to 0.34 samples/sec. Total training time increases by ~13% (83.3 → 94.1 GPU hours). No extra GPUs, no extra memory. In short, iGRPO adds a self-feedback refinement loop to group-based RL that uses the model's own best draft as conditioning. It's simple, adds minimal overhead, generalizes across optimizers, and consistently improves reasoning across model families and scales.",

We present a trajectory expansion framework Anchor that bootstraps scalable desktop supervision from a small set of verified seed demonstrations. Starting from each seed, we identify branch points that correspond to meaningful state changes and propose new, state-grounded task variants conditioned on the current GUI context. An executing agent then follows the proposed instructions to generate new trajectories, while a verifier enforces task completion via state-aware checks and trajectory-level consistency. To improve supervision quality, we further apply task-conditioned step-level filtering to remove ungrounded actions and denoise post-branch segments to maintain coherent intent. Experiments on standard desktop benchmarks, OSWorld and WindowsAgentArena, show that models fine-tuned on our expanded corpus achieve consistent improvements over zero-shot agents and representative synthesis baselines, and generalize across applications and operating systems.",

      "abstract": "Parallel thinking has emerged as a new paradigm for large reasoning models (LRMs) in tackling complex problems. Recent methods leverage Reinforcement Learning (RL) to enhance parallel thinking, aiming to address the limitations in computational resources and effectiveness encountered with supervised fine-tuning. However, most existing studies primarily focus on optimizing the aggregation phase, with limited attention to the path exploration stage. In this paper, we theoretically analyze the optimization of parallel thinking under the Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) setting, and identify that the mutual information bottleneck among exploration paths fundamentally restricts overall performance. To address this, we propose Outline-Guided Path Exploration (OPE) , which explicitly partitions the solution space by generating diverse reasoning outlines prior to parallel path reasoning, thereby reducing information redundancy and improving the diversity of information captured across exploration paths. We implement OPE with an iterative RL strategy that optimizes outline planning and outline-guided reasoning independently. Extensive experiments across multiple challenging mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that OPE effectively improves reasoning performance in different aggregation strategies, enabling LRMs to more reliably discover correct solutions.",

To address this limitation, we introduce TodoEvolve, a meta-planning paradigm that autonomously synthesizes and dynamically revises task-specific planning architectures. Specifically, we first construct PlanFactory, a modular design space that standardizes diverse planning paradigms within a unified codebase encompassing topology, initialization, adaptation, and navigation, thereby providing a common interface for heterogeneous planning patterns. Leveraging PlanFactory, we collect high-quality planning trajectories and train Todo-14B via \\textit{Impedance-Guided Preference Optimization} (IGPO), a multi-objective reinforcement learning objective that encourages the generation of planning systems that are performant, stable, and token-efficient across arbitrary tasks and agent backbones. Empirical evaluations on five agentic benchmarks demonstrate that TodoEvolve consistently surpasses carefully engineered planning modules while maintaining economical API costs and runtime overhead.",

Existing secure code alignment methods often suffer from a functionality–security paradox, improving security at the cost of substantial utility degradation. We propose SecCoderX, an online reinforcement learning framework for functionalitypreserving secure code generation. SecCoderX first bridges vulnerability detection and secure code generation by repurposing mature detection resources in two ways: (i) synthesizing diverse, reality grounded vulnerability-inducing coding tasks for online RL rollouts, and (ii) training a reasoning based vulnerability reward model that provides scalable and reliable security supervision. Together, these components are unified in an online RL loop to align code LLMs to generate secure and functional code. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SecCoderX achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving Effective Safety Rate (ESR) by approximately 10% over unaligned models, whereas prior methods often degrade ESR by 14-54%.

      "abstract": "While flow matching is elegant, its reliance on single-sample conditional velocities leads to high-variance training targets that destabilize optimization and slow convergence. By explicitly characterizing this variance, we identify 1) a high-variance regime near the prior, where optimization is challenging, and 2) a low-variance regime near the data distribution, where conditional and marginal velocities nearly coincide. Leveraging this insight, we propose Stable Velocity , a unified framework that improves both training and sampling. For training, we introduce Stable Velocity Matching (StableVM), an unbiased variance-reduction objective, along with Variance-Aware Representation Alignment (VA-REPA), which adaptively strengthen auxiliary supervision in the low-variance regime. For inference, we show that dynamics in the low-variance regime admit closed-form simplifications, enabling Stable Velocity Sampling (StableVS), a finetuning-free acceleration. Extensive experiments on ImageNet $256\\times256$ and large pretrained text-to-image and text-to-video models, including SD3.5, Flux, Qwen-Image, and Wan2.2, demonstrate consistent improvements in training efficiency and more than $2\\times$ faster sampling within the low-variance regime without degrading sample quality.",

In this work, we leverage Mixture of Factor Analyzers (MFA) as a scalable, unsupervised alternative that models the activation space as a collection of Gaussian regions with their local covariance structure. MFA decomposes activations into two compositional geometric objects: the region's centroid in activation space, and the local variation from the centroid. We train large-scale MFAs for Llama-3.1-8B and Gemma-2-2B, and show they capture complex, nonlinear structures in activation space. Moreover, evaluations on localization and steering benchmarks show that MFA outperforms unsupervised baselines, is competitive with supervised localization methods, and often achieves stronger steering performance than sparse autoencoders. Together, our findings position local geometry, expressed through subspaces, as a promising unit of analysis for scalable concept discovery and model control, accounting for complex structures that isolated directions fail to capture.",

However, standard diffusion transformers fail to converge on these representations directly. While recent work attributes this to a capacity bottleneck proposing computationally expensive width scaling of diffusion transformers we demonstrate that the failure is fundamentally geometric. We identify Geometric Interference as the root cause: standard Euclidean flow matching forces probability paths through the low-density interior of the hyperspherical feature space of representation encoders, rather than following the manifold surface. To resolve this, we propose Riemannian Flow Matching with Jacobi Regularization (RJF). By constraining the generative process to the manifold geodesics and correcting for curvature-induced error propagation, RJF enables standard Diffusion Transformer architectures to converge without width scaling. Our method RJF enables the standard DiT-B architecture (131M parameters) to converge effectively, achieving an FID of 3.37 where prior methods fail to converge.",

I tested the opposite on GPU kernel optimization and found that selecting by surprisal (the model's least confident correct solution) achieves 80% success vs 50% for confidence-guided, with a 3.5x mean speedup advantage. Evaluating just the top 3 by surprisal matches oracle performance at 100%. The key insight: a model's probability distribution maps frequency, not quality. Expert-level CUDA kernels are rare in training data, so the model assigns them low probability despite high performance. That signal is already in the logprobs at zero additional inference cost. I also find that test-time training (gradient adaptation) is worse than random on dense-reward tasks. TTT's best checkpoint (30.6%) falls below a single random sample (53.3%).

      "abstract": "Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved impressive performance in cross-modal understanding across textual and visual inputs, yet existing benchmarks predominantly focus on pure-text queries. In real-world scenarios, language also frequently appears as visualized text embedded in images, raising the question of whether current VLMs handle such input requests comparably. We introduce VISTA-Bench, a systematic benchmark from multimodal perception, reasoning, to unimodal understanding domains. It evaluates visualized text understanding by contrasting pure-text and visualized-text questions under controlled rendering conditions. Extensive evaluation of over 20 representative VLMs reveals a pronounced modality gap: models that perform well on pure-text queries often degrade substantially when equivalent semantic content is presented as visualized text. This gap is further amplified by increased perceptual difficulty, highlighting sensitivity to rendering variations despite unchanged semantics. Overall, VISTA-Bench provides a principled evaluation framework to diagnose this limitation and to guide progress toward more unified language representations across tokenized text and pixels.

      "title": "SafePred: A Predictive Guardrail for Computer-Using Agents via World Models",
      "abstract": "With the widespread deployment of Computer-using Agents (CUAs) in complex real-world environments, prevalent long-term risks often lead to severe and irreversible consequences. Most existing guardrails for CUAs adopt a reactive approach, constraining agent behavior only within the current observation space. While these guardrails can prevent immediate short-term risks (e.g., clicking on a phishing link), they cannot proactively avoid long-term risks: seemingly reasonable actions can lead to high-risk consequences that emerge with a delay (e.g., cleaning logs leads to future audits being untraceable), which reactive guardrails cannot identify within the current observation space. To address these limitations, we propose a predictive guardrail approach, with the core idea of aligning predicted future risks with current decisions. Based on this approach, we present SafePred, a predictive guardrail framework for CUAs that establishes a risk-to-decision loop to ensure safe agent behavior. SafePred supports two key abilities: (1) Short- and long-term risk prediction: by using safety policies as the basis for risk prediction, SafePred leverages the prediction capability of the world model to generate semantic representations of both short-term and long-term risks, thereby identifying and pruning actions that lead to high-risk states; (2) Decision optimization: translating predicted risks into actionable safe decision guidances through step-level interventions and task-level re-planning. Extensive experiments show that SafePred significantly reduces high-risk behaviors, achieving over 97.6% safety performance and improving task utility by up to 21.4% compared with reactive baselines.",

      "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-stakes domains, where rare but severe failures can result in irreversible harm. However, prevailing evaluation benchmarks often reduce complex social risk to mean-centered scalar scores, thereby obscuring distributional structure, cross-dimensional interactions, and worst-case behavior. This paper introduces Social Harm Analysis via Risk Profiles (SHARP), a framework for multidimensional, distribution-aware evaluation of social harm. SHARP models harm as a multivariate random variable and integrates explicit decomposition into bias, fairness, ethics, and epistemic reliability with a union-of-failures aggregation reparameterized as additive cumulative log-risk. The framework further employs risk-sensitive distributional statistics, with Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR95) as a primary metric, to characterize worst-case model behavior. Application of SHARP to eleven frontier LLMs, evaluated on a fixed corpus of n=901 socially sensitive prompts, reveals that models with similar average risk can exhibit more than twofold differences in tail exposure and volatility. Across models, dimension-wise marginal tail behavior varies systematically across harm dimensions, with bias exhibiting the strongest tail severities, epistemic and fairness risks occupying intermediate regimes, and ethical misalignment consistently lower; together, these patterns reveal heterogeneous, model-dependent failure structures that scalar benchmarks conflate. These findings indicate that responsible evaluation and governance of LLMs require moving beyond scalar averages toward multidimensional, tail-sensitive risk profiling.",

Prompt and schema engineering is easy to deploy but often fragile under distribution shift and strict parsers, while continual parameter-efficient fine-tuning improves reliability at the cost of training, maintenance, and potential forgetting. We identify a critical Lazy Agent failure mode where tool necessity is nearly perfectly decodable from mid-layer activations, yet the model remains conservative in entering tool mode, revealing a representation-behavior gap. We propose Activation Steering Adapter (ASA), a training-free, inference-time controller that performs a single-shot mid-layer intervention and targets tool domains via a router-conditioned mixture of steering vectors with a probe-guided signed gate to amplify true intent while suppressing spurious triggers. On MTU-Bench with Qwen2.5-1.5B, ASA improves strict tool-use F1 from 0.18 to 0.50 while reducing the false positive rate from 0.15 to 0.05, using only about 20KB of portable assets and no weight updates.",

      "abstract": "Omni-modal large language models (OLLMs) aim to unify multimodal understanding and generation, yet incorporating speech with 3D facial animation remains largely unexplored despite its importance for natural interaction. A key challenge arises from the representation mismatch between discrete, token-level semantic reasoning in LLMs and the dense, fine-grained temporal dynamics required for 3D facial motion, which makes direct modeling difficult to optimize under limited data. We propose Expressive Omni (Ex-Omni), an open-source omni-modal framework that augments OLLMs with speech-accompanied 3D facial animation. Ex-Omni reduces learning difficulty by decoupling semantic reasoning from temporal generation, leveraging speech units as temporal scaffolding and a unified token-as-query gated fusion (TQGF) mechanism for controlled semantic injection. We further introduce InstructEx, a dataset aims to facilitate augment OLLMs with speech-accompanied 3D facial animation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Ex-Omni performs competitively against existing open-source OLLMs while enabling stable aligned speech and facial animation generation.",

We introduce EcoGym, a generalizable benchmark for continuous plan-and-execute decision making in interactive economies. EcoGym comprises three diverse environments: Vending, Freelance, and Operation, implemented in a unified decision-making process with standardized interfaces, and budgeted actions over an effectively unbounded horizon (1000+ steps if 365 day-loops for evaluation). The evaluation of EcoGym is based on business-relevant outcomes (e.g., net worth, income, and DAU), targeting long-term strategic coherence and robustness under partial observability and stochasticity. Experiments across eleven leading LLMs expose a systematic tension: no single model dominates across all three scenarios. Critically, we find that models exhibit significant suboptimality in either high-level strategies or efficient actions executions. EcoGym is released as an open, extensible testbed for transparent long-horizon agent evaluation and for studying controllability-utility trade-offs in realistic economic settings.",

      "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently strengthened LLM reasoning, but its focus on final answer correctness leaves a critical gap: it does not ensure the robustness of the reasoning process itself. We adopt a simple philosophical view, robust reasoning should remain useful beyond the mind that produced it, and treat reasoning as a form of meaning transfer that must survive truncation, reinterpretation, and continuation. Building on this principle, we introduce Reinforcement Learning with Transferable Reward (RLTR), which operationalizes robustness via transfer reward that tests whether a partial reasoning prefix from one model can guide a separate model to the correct answer. This encourages LLMs to produce reasoning that is stable, interpretable, and genuinely generalizable. Our approach improves sampling consistency while improving final answer accuracy, and it reaches comparable performance in substantially fewer training steps. For example, on MATH500, RLTR achieves a +3.6%p gain in Maj@64 compared to RLVR and matches RLVR's average accuracy with roughly 2.5x fewer training steps, providing both more reliable reasoning and significantly more sample efficient.",

      "abstract": "The Magic of Forgetting! Reasoning models enhance problem-solving by scaling test-time compute, yet they face a critical paradox: excessive thinking tokens often degrade performance rather than improve it. We attribute this to a fundamental architectural flaw: standard LLMs operate as \"malloc-only\" engines, continuously accumulating valid and redundant steps alike without a mechanism to prune obsolete information. To break this cycle, we propose Free()LM, a model that introduces an intrinsic self-forgetting capability via the Free-Module, a plug-and-play LoRA adapter. By iteratively switching between reasoning and cleaning modes, Free()LM dynamically identifies and prunes useless context chunks, maintaining a compact and noise-free state. Extensive experiments show that Free()LM provides consistent improvements across all model scales (8B to 685B). It achieves a 3.3% average improvement over top-tier reasoning baselines, even establishing a new SOTA on IMOanswerBench using DeepSeek V3.2-Speciale. Most notably, in long-horizon tasks where the standard Qwen3-235B-A22B model suffers a total collapse (0% accuracy), Free()LM restores performance to 50%. Our findings suggest that sustainable intelligence requires the freedom to forget as much as the power to think.",

      "abstract": "Reasoning Cache: Continual Improvement Over Long Horizons via Short-Horizon RL Large Language Models (LLMs) that can continually improve beyond their training budgets are able to solve increasingly difficult problems by adapting at test time, a property we refer to as extrapolation. However, standard reinforcement learning (RL) operates over fixed problem distributions and training budgets, which limits extrapolation amidst distribution shift at test time. To address this, we introduce RC, an iterative decoding algorithm that replaces standard autoregressive decoding during both training and inference. RC exploits an asymmetry between the response generation and summarization capabilities of LLMs to construct reasoning chains that consistently improve across iterations. Models trained to use RC can extrapolate and continually improve over reasoning horizons more than an order of magnitude longer than those seen during training. Empirically, training a 4B model with RC using a 16k-token training budget improves performance on HMMT 2025 from 40% to nearly 70% with 0.5m tokens at test time, outperforming both comparably sized models and many larger reasoning LLMs. Finally, we also show that models trained with RC can more effectively leverage existing scaffolds to further scale test-time performance, due to the improved summary-conditioned generation abilities learned through training.",

Based on the observation that teacher trajectories exhibit inherently non-linear dynamics, ArcFlow introduces a momentum-based velocity parameterization with an analytic solver to enable more faithful alignment under very few NFEs. Across Qwen-Image-20B and FLUX.1-dev, we find that this formulation results in stable 2-step generation with lightweight LoRA tuning, while maintaining strong alignment with the teacher distribution. We hope this perspective may provide a useful direction for improving efficiency without sacrificing trajectory fidelity.",

      "title": "UMEM: Unified Memory Extraction and Management Framework for Generalizable Memory",
      "abstract": "UMEM: Unified Memory Extraction and Management Framework for Generalizable Memory This paper presents a systematic solution to a core bottleneck in self-evolving agents, offering the following notable contributions: Core Problem Insight The authors accurately identify a fundamental limitation in existing approaches: the decoupled treatment of memory extraction and memory management . Current state-of-the-art methods (e.g., ReMem, Memp) focus solely on optimizing management strategies while treating extraction as a static prompting process. This design leads to two critical pitfalls: Instance-level noise accumulation : Blindly memorizing concrete details rather than generalizable principles results in a \"rote memorization\" trap. Strategy misalignment : Low-quality extracted memories render even optimal management strategies ineffective, creating a \"garbage in, garbage out\" vicious cycle. Methodological Innovations UMEM's key innovation lies in the end-to-end joint optimization of extraction and management , with three pivotal designs ensuring generalizability: Semantic Neighborhood Modeling : Queries are clustered based on cosine similarity, transforming cross-task generalization into an intra-neighborhood consistency optimization problem. Theoretical guarantees for retrieval stability are provided via formal lemmas. Marginal Utility Reward : Memory value is evaluated at the neighborhood level through a novel reward combining success gain and efficiency regularization, compelling the agent to discard instance-specific noise. Online Memory Evolution : The memory bank is dynamically updated during training, enabling co-evolution of policy learning and memory states, thereby overcoming limitations imposed by static memory assumptions. Comprehensive Experimental Validation UMEM achieves significant performance gains over baselines across five heterogeneous benchmarks (AIME, GPQA, ALFWorld, etc.), with improvements up to 10.67% on multi-turn interactive tasks. Ablation studies compellingly demonstrate that optimizing extraction alone is more critical than optimizing management alone (performance drop of 4.70 points vs. 0.73 points), challenging the prevailing \"management-first\" paradigm. Continual evolution experiments reveal that UMEM exhibits a monotonically improving trajectory , whereas baselines such as ReMem rapidly degrade due to noise accumulation—validating the long-term value of the generalization-oriented design. Cross-model transfer experiments (Qwen3 → GPT-5.1 → Gemini) confirm that extracted memories possess architecture-agnostic utility. Broader Impact and Implications This work redefines the optimization paradigm for self-evolving agents: memory quality hinges on the synergy between extraction and management, rather than maximal optimization of either component in isolation . The \"neighborhood generalization\" principle offers valuable insights for continual learning and experience transfer. Notably, the paper draws an analogy between agent evolution and neural network training (forward inference + backward optimization), providing a fresh perspective on understanding learning mechanisms in LLM-based agents. Directions for Further Discussion The reliance on pretrained encoders for semantic neighborhood construction warrants deeper investigation into generalization boundaries under out-of-distribution tasks. Trade-offs between computational overhead (evaluating N neighborhood queries) and real-time deployment requirements merit further exploration. Potential complementarity with parameter-based continual learning approaches remains an open avenue for integration. In summary, through rigorous problem deconstruction and an innovative joint optimization framework, UMEM establishes a vital pathway toward building truly sustainable self-evolving agents. It represents a substantive and well-grounded contribution to the field of memory-augmented agent research.",

Vision-language-action (VLA) models offer a promising framework, but they assume temporally aligned reasoning and control, despite semantic inference being inherently delayed relative to real-time action. We introduce Think-in-Control (TIC)-VLA, a latency-aware framework that explicitly models delayed semantic reasoning during action generation. TIC-VLA defines a delayed semantic-control interface that conditions action generation on delayed vision-language semantic states and explicit latency metadata, in addition to current observations, enabling policies to compensate for asynchronous reasoning. We further propose a latency-consistent training pipeline that injects reasoning inference delays during imitation learning and online reinforcement learning, aligning training with asynchronous deployment. To support realistic evaluation, we present DynaNav, a physics-accurate, photo-realistic simulation suite for language-guided navigation in dynamic environments. Extensive experiments in simulation and on a real robot show that TIC-VLA consistently outperforms prior VLA models while maintaining robust real-time control under multi-second reasoning latency.",

      "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for code generation in fast, informal development workflows, often referred to as vibe coding, where speed and convenience are prioritized, and security requirements are rarely made explicit. In this setting, models frequently produce functionally correct but insecure code, creating a growing security risk. Existing approaches to improving code security rely on full-parameter fine-tuning or parameter-efficient adaptations, which are either costly and prone to catastrophic forgetting or operate at coarse granularity with limited interpretability and control. We present GoodVibe, a neuron-level framework for improving the security of code language models by default. GoodVibe is based on the key insight that security-relevant reasoning is localized to a small subset of neurons. We identify these neurons using gradient-based attribution from a supervised security task and perform neuron-selective fine-tuning that updates only this security-critical subspace. To further reduce training cost, we introduce activation-driven neuron clustering, enabling structured updates with minimal overhead. We evaluate GoodVibe on six LLMs across security-critical programming languages, including C++, Java, Swift, and Go. GoodVibe substantially improves the security of generated code while preserving general model utility, achieving up to a 2.5x improvement over base models, matching or exceeding full fine-tuning with over 4,700x fewer trainable parameters, and reducing training computation by more than 3.6x compared to the parameter-efficient baseline (LoRA). Our results demonstrate that neuron-level optimization offers an effective and scalable approach to securing code generation without sacrificing efficiency or generality.",

      "abstract": "The rapid adoption of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures marks a major shift in the deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs). MoE LLMs improve scaling efficiency by activating only a small subset of parameters per token, but their routing structure introduces new safety attack surfaces. We find that safety-critical behaviors in MoE LLMs (e.g., refusal) are concentrated in a small set of experts rather than being uniformly distributed. Building on this, we propose Large Language Lobotomy (L), a training-free, architecture-agnostic attack that compromises safety alignment by exploiting expert routing dynamics. L learns routing patterns that correlate with refusal, attributes safety behavior to specific experts, and adaptively silences the most safety-relevant experts until harmful outputs are produced. We evaluate L on eight state-of-the-art open-source MoE LLMs and show that our adaptive expert silencing increases average attack success from 7.3% to 70.4%, reaching up to 86.3%, outperforming prior training-free MoE jailbreak methods. Moreover, bypassing guardrails typically requires silencing fewer than 20% of layer-wise experts while largely preserving general language utility. These results reveal a fundamental tension between efficiency-driven MoE design and robust safety alignment and motivate distributing safety mechanisms more robustly in future MoE LLMs with architecture- and routing-aware methods.",

Ideally, such systems would achieve continuous self-improvement in a fully closed loop while maintaining robust safety alignment--a combination we term the self-evolution trilemma. However, we demonstrate both theoretically and empirically that an agent society satisfying continuous self-evolution, complete isolation, and safety invariance is impossible. Drawing on an information-theoretic framework, we formalize safety as the divergence degree from anthropic value distributions. We theoretically demonstrate that isolated self-evolution induces statistical blind spots, leading to the irreversible degradation of the system's safety alignment. Empirical and qualitative results from an open-ended agent community (Moltbook) and two closed self-evolving systems reveal phenomena that align with our theoretical prediction of inevitable safety erosion. We further propose several solution directions to alleviate the identified safety concern. Our work establishes a fundamental limit on the self-evolving AI societies and shifts the discourse from symptom-driven safety patches to a principled understanding of intrinsic dynamical risks, highlighting the need for external oversight or novel safety-preserving mechanisms.",

      "abstract": "Legal reasoning requires not only correct outcomes but also procedurally compliant reasoning processes. However, existing methods lack mechanisms to verify intermediate reasoning steps, allowing errors such as inapplicable statute citations to propagate undetected through the reasoning chain. To address this, we propose LawThinker, an autonomous legal research agent that adopts an Explore-Verify-Memorize strategy for dynamic judicial environments. The core idea is to enforce verification as an atomic operation after every knowledge exploration step. A DeepVerifier module examines each retrieval result along three dimensions of knowledge accuracy, fact-law relevance, and procedural compliance, with a memory module for cross-round knowledge reuse in long-horizon tasks. Experiments on the dynamic benchmark J1-EVAL show that LawThinker achieves a 24% improvement over direct reasoning and an 11% gain over workflow-based methods, with particularly strong improvements on process-oriented metrics. Evaluations on three static benchmarks further confirm its generalization capability.",

      "abstract": "The core idea of Thinking with Drafting (TwD) is super refreshing: instead of letting a multimodal model “guess the answer” with fluent CoT or pretty-looking diagrams, it forces the model to draft its reasoning into executable structure. Not vibes. Not plausible pixels. But strict, renderable DSL code. The “optical decompression” framing is also 🔥 — OCR gives you symbols, but not logical topology. TwD says: real understanding = reconstructing the hidden structure behind those symbols. And the moment the model has to commit to aligned segments, brackets, and cross-row constraints, hallucination becomes much harder. What I like most is the shift from: generate explanation → hope it’s right to generate structure → verify it deterministically That feels like a big step toward trustworthy multimodal reasoning.",

      "title": "Stroke of Surprise: Progressive Semantic Illusions in Vector Sketching",
      "abstract": "Visual illusions traditionally rely on spatial manipulations such as multi-view consistency. In this work, we introduce Progressive Semantic Illusions, a novel vector sketching task where a single sketch undergoes a dramatic semantic transformation through the sequential addition of strokes. We present Stroke of Surprise, a generative framework that optimizes vector strokes to satisfy distinct semantic interpretations at different drawing stages. The core challenge lies in the \"dual-constraint\": initial prefix strokes must form a coherent object (e.g., a duck) while simultaneously serving as the structural foundation for a second concept (e.g., a sheep) upon adding delta strokes. To address this, we propose a sequence-aware joint optimization framework driven by a dual-branch Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) mechanism. Unlike sequential approaches that freeze the initial state, our method dynamically adjusts prefix strokes to discover a \"common structural subspace\" valid for both targets. Furthermore, we introduce a novel Overlay Loss that enforces spatial complementarity, ensuring structural integration rather than occlusion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in recognizability and illusion strength, successfully expanding visual anagrams from the spatial to the temporal dimension.",

      "abstract": "Diffusion large language models (DLLMs) have the potential to enable fast text generation by decoding multiple tokens in parallel. However, in practice, their inference efficiency is constrained by the need for many refinement steps, while aggressively reducing the number of steps leads to a substantial degradation in generation quality. To alleviate this, we propose a trajectory self-distillation framework that improves few-step decoding by distilling the model's own generative trajectories. We incorporate Direct Discriminative Optimization (DDO), a reverse-KL objective that promotes mode-seeking distillation and encourages the student to concentrate on high-probability teacher modes. Across benchmarks, our approach consistently outperforms strong few-step baselines and standard training under tight step budgets. Although full-step decoding remains superior, we substantially narrow the gap, establishing a strong foundation towards practical few-step DLLMs.",

      "abstract": "Personalized alignment of large language models seeks to adapt responses to individual user preferences, typically via reinforcement learning. A key challenge is obtaining accurate, user-specific reward signals in open-ended scenarios. Existing personalized reward models face two persistent limitations: (1) oversimplifying diverse, scenario-specific preferences into a small, fixed set of evaluation principles, and (2) struggling with generalization to new users with limited feedback. To this end, we propose P-GenRM, the first Personalized Generative Reward Model with test-time user-based scaling. P-GenRM transforms preference signals into structured evaluation chains that derive adaptive personas and scoring rubrics across various scenarios. It further clusters users into User Prototypes and introduces a dual-granularity scaling mechanism: at the individual level, it adaptively scales and aggregates each user's scoring scheme; at the prototype level, it incorporates preferences from similar users. This design mitigates noise in inferred preferences and enhances generalization to unseen users through prototype-based transfer. Empirical results show that P-GenRM achieves state-of-the-art results on widely-used personalized reward model benchmarks, with an average improvement of 2.31%, and demonstrates strong generalization on an out-of-distribution dataset. Notably, Test-time User-based scaling provides an additional 3% boost, demonstrating stronger personalized alignment with test-time scalability.",

      "abstract": "Metaphorical comprehension in images remains a critical challenge for Nowadays AI systems. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at basic Visual Question Answering (VQA), they consistently struggle to grasp the nuanced cultural, emotional, and contextual implications embedded in visual content. This difficulty stems from the task's demand for sophisticated multi-hop reasoning, cultural context, and Theory of Mind (ToM) capabilities, which current models lack. To fill this gap, we propose MetaphorStar, the first end-to-end visual reinforcement learning (RL) framework for image implication tasks. Our framework includes three core components: the fine-grained dataset TFQ-Data, the visual RL method TFQ-GRPO, and the well-structured benchmark TFQ-Bench. Our fully open-source MetaphorStar family, trained using TFQ-GRPO on TFQ-Data, significantly improves performance by an average of 82.6% on the image implication benchmarks. Compared with 20+ mainstream MLLMs, MetaphorStar-32B achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) on Multiple-Choice Question and Open-Style Question, significantly outperforms the top closed-source model Gemini-3.0-pro on True-False Question. Crucially, our experiments reveal that learning image implication tasks improves the general understanding ability, especially the complex visual reasoning ability. We further provide a systematic analysis of model parameter scaling, training data scaling, and the impact of different model architectures and training strategies, demonstrating the broad applicability of our method. We open-sourced all model weights, datasets, and method code.",

This setting is common in 🔬 scientific reasoning and 📐 mathematical proofs, where correct solutions are often non unique and expressed as structured natural language rather than fixed outputs. Traditional reward signals simply do not work in these scenarios. To address this, we propose a ✨ geometric consensus reward that models agreement, reliability, and diversity, enabling RL training without ground truth final answers.

This paper introduces ScalSelect, a training-free and gradient-free data selection method with linear-time complexity, specifically designed for visual instruction tuning. 💡 Key Ideas Leverages instruction-conditioned attention representations to better capture instruction-relevant visual signals Selects samples from a dominant global subspace, rather than relying on pairwise similarity or proxy model training Scalable — no additional models, no additional datasets, training-free, no gradient training, linear-time complexity with respect to data size,  required for selection 📊 Results Using only 16% of the data, ScalSelect retains ≥97.5% of full-data performance, and in some cases even surpasses training on the entire dataset. 🚀 Why It Matters ScalSelect provides a practical and scalable solution for multimodal training. As VLMs continue to scale, data curation becomes increasingly critical — and this work offers a simple yet principled direction forward. Code: https://github.com/ChangtiWu/ScalSelect",

      "abstract": "Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) is central to training modern reasoning models, but the undisclosed training data raises concerns about benchmark contamination. Unlike pretraining methods, which optimize models using token-level probabilities, RLVR fine-tunes models based on reward feedback from self-generated reasoning trajectories, making conventional likelihood-based detection methods less effective. We show that RLVR induces a distinctive behavioral signature: prompts encountered during RLVR training result in more rigid and similar generations, while unseen prompts retain greater diversity. We introduce Min-kNN Distance, a simple black-box detector that quantifies this collapse by sampling multiple completions for a given prompt and computing the average of the k smallest nearest-neighbor edit distances. Min-kNN Distance requires no access to the reference model or token probabilities. Experiments across multiple RLVR-trained reasoning models show that Min-kNN Distance reliably distinguishes RL-seen examples from unseen ones and outperforms existing membership inference and RL contamination detection baselines.",

      "abstract": "The emergence of multi-agent systems built from large language models (LLMs) offers a promising paradigm for scalable collective intelligence and self-evolution. Ideally, such systems would achieve continuous self-improvement in a fully closed loop while maintaining robust safety alignment--a combination we term the self-evolution trilemma. However, we demonstrate both theoretically and empirically that an agent society satisfying continuous self-evolution, complete isolation, and safety invariance is impossible. Drawing on an information-theoretic framework, we formalize safety as the divergence degree from anthropic value distributions. We theoretically demonstrate that isolated self-evolution induces statistical blind spots, leading to the irreversible degradation of the system's safety alignment. Empirical and qualitative results from an open-ended agent community (Moltbook) and two closed self-evolving systems reveal phenomena that align with our theoretical prediction of inevitable safety erosion. We further propose several solution directions to alleviate the identified safety concern. Our work establishes a fundamental limit on the self-evolving AI societies and shifts the discourse from symptom-driven safety patches to a principled understanding of intrinsic dynamical risks, highlighting the need for external oversight or novel safety-preserving mechanisms.",

      "abstract": "Legal reasoning requires not only correct outcomes but also procedurally compliant reasoning processes. However, existing methods lack mechanisms to verify intermediate reasoning steps, allowing errors such as inapplicable statute citations to propagate undetected through the reasoning chain. To address this, we propose LawThinker, an autonomous legal research agent that adopts an Explore-Verify-Memorize strategy for dynamic judicial environments. The core idea is to enforce verification as an atomic operation after every knowledge exploration step. A DeepVerifier module examines each retrieval result along three dimensions of knowledge accuracy, fact-law relevance, and procedural compliance, with a memory module for cross-round knowledge reuse in long-horizon tasks. Experiments on the dynamic benchmark J1-EVAL show that LawThinker achieves a 24% improvement over direct reasoning and an 11% gain over workflow-based methods, with particularly strong improvements on process-oriented metrics. Evaluations on three static benchmarks further confirm its generalization capability.",

      "abstract": "The core idea of Thinking with Drafting (TwD) is super refreshing: instead of letting a multimodal model “guess the answer” with fluent CoT or pretty-looking diagrams, it forces the model to draft its reasoning into executable structure. Not vibes. Not plausible pixels. But strict, renderable DSL code. The “optical decompression” framing is also 🔥 — OCR gives you symbols, but not logical topology. TwD says: real understanding = reconstructing the hidden structure behind those symbols. And the moment the model has to commit to aligned segments, brackets, and cross-row constraints, hallucination becomes much harder. What I like most is the shift from: generate explanation → hope it’s right to generate structure → verify it deterministically That feels like a big step toward trustworthy multimodal reasoning.",

      "abstract": "Visual illusions traditionally rely on spatial manipulations such as multi-view consistency. In this work, we introduce Progressive Semantic Illusions, a novel vector sketching task where a single sketch undergoes a dramatic semantic transformation through the sequential addition of strokes. We present Stroke of Surprise, a generative framework that optimizes vector strokes to satisfy distinct semantic interpretations at different drawing stages. The core challenge lies in the \"dual-constraint\": initial prefix strokes must form a coherent object (e.g., a duck) while simultaneously serving as the structural foundation for a second concept (e.g., a sheep) upon adding delta strokes. To address this, we propose a sequence-aware joint optimization framework driven by a dual-branch Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) mechanism. Unlike sequential approaches that freeze the initial state, our method dynamically adjusts prefix strokes to discover a \"common structural subspace\" valid for both targets. Furthermore, we introduce a novel Overlay Loss that enforces spatial complementarity, ensuring structural integration rather than occlusion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in recognizability and illusion strength, successfully expanding visual anagrams from the spatial to the temporal dimension.",

Real-world zero-shot experiments show 2.5× higher success rate than state-of-the-art LLM baselines and mark the first realization in challenging night scenes. Highlights We investigate beyond-the-view navigation tasks in the real world by introducing video generation model to this field for the first time. We pioneer a paradigm shift from continuous to sparse video generation for longer prediction horizon. We achieve sub-second trajectory inference guided by a generated sparse future spanning a 20-second horizon. This yields a remarkable 27x speed-up compared to the unoptimized counterpart. We achieve the first realization of beyond-the-view navigation in challenging night scenes with a 17.5% success rate.",

      "abstract": "Diffusion large language models (DLLMs) have the potential to enable fast text generation by decoding multiple tokens in parallel. However, in practice, their inference efficiency is constrained by the need for many refinement steps, while aggressively reducing the number of steps leads to a substantial degradation in generation quality. To alleviate this, we propose a trajectory self-distillation framework that improves few-step decoding by distilling the model's own generative trajectories. We incorporate Direct Discriminative Optimization (DDO), a reverse-KL objective that promotes mode-seeking distillation and encourages the student to concentrate on high-probability teacher modes. Across benchmarks, our approach consistently outperforms strong few-step baselines and standard training under tight step budgets. Although full-step decoding remains superior, we substantially narrow the gap, establishing a strong foundation towards practical few-step DLLMs.",

      "abstract": "Metaphorical comprehension in images remains a critical challenge for Nowadays AI systems. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at basic Visual Question Answering (VQA), they consistently struggle to grasp the nuanced cultural, emotional, and contextual implications embedded in visual content. This difficulty stems from the task's demand for sophisticated multi-hop reasoning, cultural context, and Theory of Mind (ToM) capabilities, which current models lack. To fill this gap, we propose MetaphorStar, the first end-to-end visual reinforcement learning (RL) framework for image implication tasks. Our framework includes three core components: the fine-grained dataset TFQ-Data, the visual RL method TFQ-GRPO, and the well-structured benchmark TFQ-Bench. Our fully open-source MetaphorStar family, trained using TFQ-GRPO on TFQ-Data, significantly improves performance by an average of 82.6% on the image implication benchmarks. Compared with 20+ mainstream MLLMs, MetaphorStar-32B achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) on Multiple-Choice Question and Open-Style Question, significantly outperforms the top closed-source model Gemini-3.0-pro on True-False Question. Crucially, our experiments reveal that learning image implication tasks improves the general understanding ability, especially the complex visual reasoning ability. We further provide a systematic analysis of model parameter scaling, training data scaling, and the impact of different model architectures and training strategies, demonstrating the broad applicability of our method. We open-sourced all model weights, datasets, and method code.",

This setting is common in 🔬 scientific reasoning and 📐 mathematical proofs, where correct solutions are often non unique and expressed as structured natural language rather than fixed outputs. Traditional reward signals simply do not work in these scenarios. To address this, we propose a ✨ geometric consensus reward that models agreement, reliability, and diversity, enabling RL training without ground truth final answers.

      "title": "P-GenRM: Personalized Generative Reward Model with Test-time User-based Scaling",
      "abstract": "Personalized alignment of large language models seeks to adapt responses to individual user preferences, typically via reinforcement learning. A key challenge is obtaining accurate, user-specific reward signals in open-ended scenarios. Existing personalized reward models face two persistent limitations: (1) oversimplifying diverse, scenario-specific preferences into a small, fixed set of evaluation principles, and (2) struggling with generalization to new users with limited feedback. To this end, we propose P-GenRM, the first Personalized Generative Reward Model with test-time user-based scaling. P-GenRM transforms preference signals into structured evaluation chains that derive adaptive personas and scoring rubrics across various scenarios. It further clusters users into User Prototypes and introduces a dual-granularity scaling mechanism: at the individual level, it adaptively scales and aggregates each user's scoring scheme; at the prototype level, it incorporates preferences from similar users. This design mitigates noise in inferred preferences and enhances generalization to unseen users through prototype-based transfer. Empirical results show that P-GenRM achieves state-of-the-art results on widely-used personalized reward model benchmarks, with an average improvement of 2.31%, and demonstrates strong generalization on an out-of-distribution dataset. Notably, Test-time User-based scaling provides an additional 3% boost, demonstrating stronger personalized alignment with test-time scalability.",

      "abstract": "Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) is central to training modern reasoning models, but the undisclosed training data raises concerns about benchmark contamination. Unlike pretraining methods, which optimize models using token-level probabilities, RLVR fine-tunes models based on reward feedback from self-generated reasoning trajectories, making conventional likelihood-based detection methods less effective. We show that RLVR induces a distinctive behavioral signature: prompts encountered during RLVR training result in more rigid and similar generations, while unseen prompts retain greater diversity. We introduce Min-kNN Distance, a simple black-box detector that quantifies this collapse by sampling multiple completions for a given prompt and computing the average of the k smallest nearest-neighbor edit distances. Min-kNN Distance requires no access to the reference model or token probabilities. Experiments across multiple RLVR-trained reasoning models show that Min-kNN Distance reliably distinguishes RL-seen examples from unseen ones and outperforms existing membership inference and RL contamination detection baselines.",
