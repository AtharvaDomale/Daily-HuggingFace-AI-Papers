We present RL-AWB, a novel framework combining statistical methods with deep reinforcement learning for nighttime white balance. Our method begins with a statistical algorithm tailored for nighttime scenes, integrating salient gray pixel detection with novel illumination estimation. Building on this foundation, we develop the first deep reinforcement learning approach for color constancy that leverages the statistical algorithm as its core, mimicking professional AWB tuning experts by dynamically optimizing parameters for each image. To facilitate cross-sensor evaluation, we introduce the first multi-sensor nighttime dataset.

      "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) for complex reasoning is often hindered by high computational costs and latency, while resource-efficient Small Language Models (SLMs) typically lack the necessary reasoning capacity. Existing collaborative approaches, such as cascading or routing, operate at a coarse granularity by offloading entire queries to LLMs, resulting in significant computational waste when the SLM is capable of handling the majority of reasoning steps. To address this, we propose RelayLLM, a novel framework for efficient reasoning via token-level collaborative decoding. Unlike routers, RelayLLM empowers the SLM to act as an active controller that dynamically invokes the LLM only for critical tokens via a special command, effectively \"relaying\" the generation process. We introduce a two-stage training framework, including warm-up and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to teach the model to balance independence with strategic help-seeking. Empirical results across six benchmarks demonstrate that RelayLLM achieves an average accuracy of 49.52%, effectively bridging the performance gap between the two models. Notably, this is achieved by invoking the LLM for only 1.07% of the total generated tokens, offering a 98.2% cost reduction compared to performance-matched random routers.",

      "abstract": "Abstract LLM agents have emerged as powerful systems for tackling multi-turn tasks by interleaving internal reasoning and external tool interactions. Agentic Reinforcement Learning has recently drawn significant research attention as a critical post-training paradigm to further refine these capabilities. In this paper, we present AT 2 PO (Agentic Turn-based Policy Optimization via Tree Search), a unified framework for multi-turn agentic RL that addresses three core challenges: limited exploration diversity, sparse credit assignment, and misaligned policy optimization. AT 2 PO introduces a turn-level tree structure that jointly enables Entropy-Guided Tree Expansion for strategic exploration and Turn-wise Credit Assignment for fine-grained reward propagation from sparse outcomes. Complementing this, we propose Agentic Turn-based Policy Optimization, a turn-level learning objective that aligns policy updates with the natural decision granularity of agentic interactions. ATPO is orthogonal to tree search and can be readily integrated into any multi-turn RL pipeline. Experiments across seven benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements over the state-of-the-art baseline by up to 1.84 percentage points in average, with ablation studies validating the effectiveness of each component.

      "abstract": "Vision-language models (VLMs) achieve remarkable performance but remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Entropy, a measure of model uncertainty, is strongly correlated with the reliability of VLM. Prior entropy-based attacks maximize uncertainty at all decoding steps, implicitly assuming that every token contributes equally to generation instability. We show instead that a small fraction (about 20%) of high-entropy tokens, i.e., critical decision points in autoregressive generation, disproportionately governs output trajectories. By concentrating adversarial perturbations on these positions, we achieve semantic degradation comparable to global methods while using substantially smaller budgets. More importantly, across multiple representative VLMs, such selective attacks convert 35-49% of benign outputs into harmful ones, exposing a more critical safety risk. Remarkably, these vulnerable high-entropy forks recur across architecturally diverse VLMs, enabling feasible transferability (17-26% harmful rates on unseen targets). Motivated by these findings, we propose Entropy-bank Guided Adversarial attacks (EGA), which achieves competitive attack success rates (93-95%) alongside high harmful conversion, thereby revealing new weaknesses in current VLM safety mechanisms.",

      "abstract": "Mixture of Experts models are widely assumed to achieve domain specialization through sparse routing. In this work, we question this assumption by introducing COMMITTEEAUDIT, a post hoc framework that analyzes routing behavior at the level of expert groups rather than individual experts. Across three representative models and the MMLU benchmark, we uncover a domain-invariant Standing Committee. This is a compact coalition of routed experts that consistently captures the majority of routing mass across domains, layers, and routing budgets, even when architectures already include shared experts. Qualitative analysis further shows that Standing Committees anchor reasoning structure and syntax, while peripheral experts handle domain-specific knowledge. These findings reveal a strong structural bias toward centralized computation, suggesting that specialization in Mixture of Experts models is far less pervasive than commonly believed. This inherent bias also indicates that current training objectives, such as load-balancing losses that enforce uniform expert utilization, may be working against the model's natural optimization path, thereby limiting training efficiency and performance.",

To enable end-to-end training of such agents, we introduce an Exploration-then-Synthesis data synthesis pipeline that addresses the scarcity of high-quality training data for DocQA. Training on the synthesized data, the trained models on two long-context document understanding benchmarks, MMLongBench-Doc and DocBench, show their effectiveness. Further analysis provides valuable insights for the agentic tool design and synthetic data.",

Our paper presents a novel pipeline to convert pretrained video diffusion models (like Wan2.1-1.3B) into efficient pyramidal ones via low-cost finetuning. Key Innovations: Efficiency via Hierarchy: We restructure the diffusion process into three spatiotemporal stages, processing high noise at lower resolutions to significantly reduce inference costs. Theoretical Generalization: We extended resolution transitions to a broader class of upsampling/downsampling functions based on orthogonal transforms. Step Distillation: A systematic study of distillation techniques for pyramidal setups, including the first successful training of Pyramidal Patchification models for few-step generation. Key Insights & Results: Near-Original Quality: Achieves video quality comparable to the original Wan model while requiring significantly less compute. Superior Motion: Our recommended recipe, PyramidalWan-DMD-PT*, provides consistent motion and fills the gap for high-performing few-step inference. Artifact Reduction: Unlike training-free acceleration methods (e.g., Jenga), our approach avoids severe scene and motion artifacts.",

By combining multi-resolution drafting with spatially informed verification, we achieve substantial speedups of up to 1.7x while maintaining high perceptual quality and semantic alignment. The Core Idea: Unlike standard methods that use raster-scan rejection, MuLo-SD exploits the spatial structure of images. We propose candidate tokens using a low-resolution drafter and a learned up-sampler, which are then verified in parallel by a high-resolution target model. Key Innovation: Local Verification 🔍 Crucially, we introduced a local rejection and resampling mechanism. Instead of discarding every token after a single error, we correct errors by focusing only on the spatial neighborhoods of rejected tokens, significantly boosting efficiency. Results at a Glance: ✅ Outperforms strong baselines like EAGLE-2 and LANTERN. ✅ Consistently delivers greater speedups across 512p and 1024p resolutions. ✅ Integrates seamlessly with unified Multimodal LLMs. 🔗 https://qualcomm-ai-research.github.io/mulo-sd-webpage",

We introduce a dense correspondence-guided pre-registration phase that initializes Gaussians with accurate geometry while jointly constructing 3D Context Proposals via cross-view clustering. Each proposal carries a global feature obtained through weighted aggregation of member embeddings, and this feature is fused onto Gaussians during direct registration to maintain per-primitive language coherence across views.

      "abstract": "Soft boundaries, like thin hairs, are commonly observed in natural and computer-generated imagery, but they remain challenging for 3D vision due to the ambiguous mixing of foreground and background cues. This paper introduces Guardians of the Hair (HairGuard), a framework designed to recover fine-grained soft boundary details in 3D vision tasks. Specifically, we first propose a novel data curation pipeline that leverages image matting datasets for training and design a depth fixer network to automatically identify soft boundary regions. With a gated residual module, the depth fixer refines depth precisely around soft boundaries while maintaining global depth quality, allowing plug-and-play integration with state-of-the-art depth models. For view synthesis, we perform depth-based forward warping to retain high-fidelity textures, followed by a generative scene painter that fills disoccluded regions and eliminates redundant background artifacts within soft boundaries. Finally, a color fuser adaptively combines warped and inpainted results to produce novel views with consistent geometry and fine-grained details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HairGuard achieves state-of-the-art performance across monocular depth estimation, stereo image/video conversion, and novel view synthesis, with significant improvements in soft boundary regions.",

      "title": "AgentDevel: Reframing Self-Evolving LLM Agents as Release Engineering",
      "abstract": "Recent progress in large language model (LLM) agents has largely focused on embedding self-improvement mechanisms inside the agent or searching over many concurrent variants. While these approaches can raise aggregate scores, they often yield unstable and hard-to-audit improvement trajectories, making it difficult to guarantee non-regression or to reason about failures across versions. We reframe agent improvement as \\textbf{release engineering}: agents are treated as shippable artifacts, and improvement is externalized into a regression-aware release pipeline. We introduce \\textbf{AgentDevel}, a release engineering pipeline that iteratively runs the current agent, produces implementation-blind, symptom-level quality signals from execution traces, synthesizes a single release candidate (RC) via executable diagnosis, and promotes it under flip-centered gating. AgentDevel features three core designs: (i) an implementation-blind LLM critic that characterizes failure appearances without accessing agent internals, (ii) script-based executable diagnosis that aggregates dominant symptom patterns and produces auditable engineering specifications, and (iii) flip-centered gating that prioritizes pass to fail regressions and fail to pass fixes as first-class evidence. Unlike population-based search or in-agent self-refinement, AgentDevel maintains a single canonical version line and emphasizes non-regression as a primary objective. Experiments on execution-heavy benchmarks demonstrate that AgentDevel yields stable improvements with significantly fewer regressions while producing reproducible, auditable artifacts. Overall, AgentDevel provides a practical development discipline for building, debugging, and releasing LLM agents as software development.",

We argue that this is an anthropocentric perspective imposed to a model that might not synthetize visual information as we do.

      "abstract": "Fine-tuning safety-aligned large language models (LLMs) can substantially compromise their safety. Previous approaches require many safety samples or calibration sets, which not only incur significant computational overhead during realignment but also lead to noticeable degradation in model utility. Contrary to this belief, we show that safety alignment can be fully recovered with only a single safety example, without sacrificing utility and at minimal cost . Remarkably, this recovery is effective regardless of the number of harmful examples used in fine-tuning or the size of the underlying model, and convergence is achieved within just a few epochs. Furthermore, we uncover the low-rank structure of the safety gradient, which explains why such efficient correction is possible. We validate our findings across five safety-aligned LLMs and multiple datasets, demonstrating the generality of our approach.",

      "abstract": "Autoformalization, which translates natural language mathematics into formal statements to enable machine reasoning, faces fundamental challenges in the wild due to the multimodal nature of the physical world, where physics requires inferring hidden constraints (e.g., mass or energy) from visual elements. To address this, we propose MMFormalizer, which extends autoformalization beyond text by integrating adaptive grounding with entities from real-world mathematical and physical domains. MMFormalizer recursively constructs formal propositions from perceptually grounded primitives through recursive grounding and axiom composition, with adaptive recursive termination ensuring that every abstraction is supported by visual evidence and anchored in dimensional or axiomatic grounding. We evaluate MMFormalizer on a new benchmark, PhyX-AF, comprising 115 curated samples from MathVerse, PhyX, Synthetic Geometry, and Analytic Geometry, covering diverse multimodal autoformalization tasks. Results show that frontier models such as GPT-5 and Gemini-3-Pro achieve the highest compile and semantic accuracy, with GPT-5 excelling in physical reasoning, while geometry remains the most challenging domain. Overall, MMFormalizer provides a scalable framework for unified multimodal autoformalization, bridging perception and formal reasoning. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first multimodal autoformalization method capable of handling classical mechanics (derived from the Hamiltonian), as well as relativity, quantum mechanics, and thermodynamics.",

      "abstract": "Glad to share our recent exploratory project: 🧪 Title: The Molecular Structure of Thought: Mapping the Topology of Long Chain-of-Thought Reasoning 🌐 arXiv: 2601.06002 ​ 🧐 Why revisit Long CoT? Recent work often focuses on “making CoT longer,” but longer traces are more likely to derail—e.g., drifting off-track, breaking logical continuity, or amplifying hallucinations—especially when attempting to cold-start genuine long-horizon reasoning from a standard instruction-tuned model. ​ A key observation is that many trajectories that merely look like long reasoning (e.g., distilling from randomly sampled ICL demonstrations, or using human-written long step-by-step solutions) are not behaviorally stable, and models frequently fail to learn robustly from them. ​ 😭  Why imitation often fails “Long” human CoT is not necessarily effective: Fine-tuning on human-written long CoT does not reliably reproduce the gains achieved by distilling from a strong reasoning model. Distill from Weak instruct model + random ICL demonstrations largely fails: Using randomly chosen 1-shot ICL examples to “fake” long reasoning for distillation leads to significant degradation, suggesting that superficial formatting is insufficient. ​- Keywords are not the driver: Replacing surface tokens (e.g., “wait”) while preserving the underlying reasoning trajectory and behavioral pattern yields similar performance, indicating that SFT primarily learns structure/behavior rather than prompt-specific keywords. ​ 🔍  Early evidence: Long CoT has stable “structural fingerprints” We observe a stable behavioral transfer graph: across different strong reasoning models and tasks, the induced distributional characteristics appear highly consistent. ​- In semantic space, we see “linking–folding” patterns: deep reasoning tends to form locally dense structures; self-reflection tends to create backward links for validation/correction; and exploration tends to form weaker cross-cluster connections. ​ 💡 Core hypothesis: effective Long CoT as a “molecular structure” High-quality Long CoT is not merely a linear chain; it is stabilized by three interaction types—analogous to chemical bonds—that organize and constrain reasoning trajectories: ​- Deep Reasoning (covalent-bond-like): forms the main reasoning backbone; if it breaks, the solution collapses. ​- Self-Reflection (hydrogen-bond-like): folds later steps back to earlier ones to verify assumptions, detect errors, and correct the path. ​- Self-Exploration (van der Waals-like): weak but important cross-domain probing that broadens coverage and discovers alternative routes. ​ An additional observation is that the Gibbs–Boltzmann energy formulation is closely aligned with the attention formulation; hence, the “energy distributions” of different bonds can be estimated directly from attention, exhibiting a stable ordering reminiscent of real chemical bond energies. ​ 🍎 “Semantic isomers” of Long CoT For the same problem, trajectories can be semantically close yet differ in the distribution and transitions of bonds, yielding distinct “isomers” with dramatically different trainability and downstream performance. ​- Two isomers that appear similar may still be incompatible: mixing them during training can trigger structural conflicts and degrade performance. ​- ICL is not inherently ineffective; it helps when demonstrations are selected such that their structural distribution aligns with the target high-quality isomer. ​ 🔧 Solution: MOLE-SYN We propose MOLE-SYN: first estimate a behavioral transfer graph from a strong reasoning model, then use it to guide a pure instruct LLM to synthesize Long CoT trajectories. ​- Empirically, distilling Qwen-2.5 with MOLE-SYN–generated trajectories can approach the effectiveness of distillation from QwQ. ​- This initialization also exhibits strong RL potential: it yields more stable RL training curves and sustained improvement headroom. Finally, different behaviors have distinct global effects: deep reasoning makes the core logic more compact, self-reflection increases overall “folding” tightness, and self-exploration expands the reachable search space. ​ 👀 A practical implication is that when CoT is heavily summarized or compressed, the “molecular structure” distribution can be destroyed, and distilled models may underperform even the original teacher. ​ If a prior viewpoint treated CoT behaviors as nodes, this work reframes them as edges that link logical states: the training target may not be “longer answers,” but a more stable reasoning skeleton controlled by structured reasoning behaviors. ​",

We compare five popular alignment objectives and various adaptation strategies from source to target, including target-domain supervised fine-tuning and pseudo-labeling, across summarization and question-answering helpfulness tasks. We found: The adaptation strategy is more influential than the alignment objective. We identify that synthetic supervision is a double-edged sword. While pseudo-labeling yields the highest target-domain win rates, it induces severe mode collapse. This diversity tax results in models that are highly reliable but linguistically monotonous, mirroring the latent templates of the teacher model. Our findings suggest a deployment recommendation: use pseudo-labeling for high-stakes and constrained tasks where reliability is paramount, but favor mixed-domain SFT and online RL for applications requiring creative or varied linguistic expression.",

We go beyond fixed compression with agentic self-compression: the agent actively emits a compression rate and is trained with a compression-aware reward to balance task success against token efficiency.

      "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have been widely applied across various domains of finance. Since their training data are largely derived from human-authored corpora, LLMs may inherit a range of human biases. Behavioral biases can lead to instability and uncertainty in decision-making, particularly when processing financial information. However, existing research on LLM bias has mainly focused on direct questioning or simplified, general-purpose settings, with limited consideration of the complex real-world financial environments and high-risk, context-sensitive, multilingual financial misinformation detection tasks (MFMD). In this work, we propose MFMD-Scen, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating behavioral biases of LLMs in MFMD across diverse economic scenarios. In collaboration with financial experts, we construct three types of complex financial scenarios: (i) role- and personality-based, (ii) role- and region-based, and (iii) role-based scenarios incorporating ethnicity and religious beliefs. We further develop a multilingual financial misinformation dataset covering English, Chinese, Greek, and Bengali. By integrating these scenarios with misinformation claims, MFMD-Scen enables a systematic evaluation of 22 mainstream LLMs. Our findings reveal that pronounced behavioral biases persist across both commercial and open-source models.",

Dual Level Credit Assessment This mechanism provides a comprehensive evaluation of query quality through both rule-based and model-based assessments. It allows for fine-grained supervision, helping to identify not just redundancy but also the usefulness of each query in the context of the search process. ii. Process Reward Mechanism The introduction of process rewards as a guiding signal for training search agents is a novel approach. It shifts the focus from solely final outcomes to the quality of intermediate queries, addressing a significant gap in existing methods that often overlook this aspect. iii. Query Refinement Strategy The framework employs a systematic query refinement process that identifies low quality queries and generates improved versions. This iterative refinement enhances the effectiveness of search trajectories, allowing agents to adaptively improve their queries based on feedback. iv. Three Stage Curriculum Learning Framework SmartSearch introduces a structured curriculum learning approach that progresses from imitation to alignment and finally to generalization. This staged learning process enables search agents to internalize query quality improvement progressively, enhancing their overall performance. v. Empirical Validation Across Diverse Benchmarks The paper presents extensive experimental results demonstrating SmartSearch's superior performance across multiple challenging knowledge-intensive tasks and web exploration scenarios. This empirical validation highlights the framework's robustness and effectiveness in real-world applications, showcasing its potential impact on future research in search agents and information retrieval.",

      "abstract": "Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has become a prominent paradigm for scaling Large Language Models (LLMs). Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), such as LoRA, is widely adopted to adapt pretrained MoE LLMs to downstream tasks. However, existing approaches assign identical LoRA ranks to all experts, overlooking the intrinsic functional specialization within MoE LLMs. This uniform allocation leads to resource mismatch, task-relevant experts are under-provisioned while less relevant ones receive redundant parameters. We propose a Dynamic Rank LoRA framework named DR-LoRA, which dynamically grows expert LoRA ranks during fine-tuning based on task-specific demands. DR-LoRA employs an Expert Saliency Scoring mechanism that integrates expert routing frequency and LoRA rank importance to quantify each expert's demand for additional capacity. Experts with higher saliency scores are prioritized for rank expansion, enabling the automatic formation of a heterogeneous rank distribution tailored to the target task. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that DR-LoRA consistently outperforms standard LoRA and static allocation strategies under the same parameter budget, achieving superior task performance with more efficient parameter utilization.",

      "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as intelligent agents that reason, plan, and interact with their environments. To effectively scale to long-horizon scenarios, a key capability for such agents is a memory mechanism that can retain, organize, and retrieve past experiences to support downstream decision-making. However, most existing approaches organize and store memories in a flat manner and rely on simple similarity-based retrieval techniques. Even when structured memory is introduced, existing methods often struggle to explicitly capture the logical relationships among experiences or memory units. Moreover, memory access is largely detached from the constructed structure and still depends on shallow semantic retrieval, preventing agents from reasoning logically over long-horizon dependencies. In this work, we propose CompassMem, an event-centric memory framework inspired by Event Segmentation Theory. CompassMem organizes memory as an Event Graph by incrementally segmenting experiences into events and linking them through explicit logical relations. This graph serves as a logic map, enabling agents to perform structured and goal-directed navigation over memory beyond superficial retrieval, progressively gathering valuable memories to support long-horizon reasoning. Experiments on LoCoMo and NarrativeQA demonstrate that CompassMem consistently improves both retrieval and reasoning performance across multiple backbone models.",

We introduce Multimodal Auto-Completion (MAC), a task that predicts upcoming characters in live chats using partially typed text and visual cues. Unlike traditional text-only auto-completion (TAC), MAC grounds predictions in multimodal context to better capture user intent. To enable this task, we adapt MMDialog and ImageChat to create benchmark datasets. We evaluate leading vision-language models (VLMs) against strong textual baselines, highlighting trade-offs in accuracy and efficiency. We present Router-Suggest, a router framework that dynamically selects between textual models and VLMs based on dialog context, along with a lightweight variant for resource-constrained environments. Router-Suggest achieves a 2.3x to 10x speedup over the best-performing VLM. A user study shows that VLMs significantly excel over textual models on user satisfaction, notably saving user typing effort and improving the quality of completions in multi-turn conversations. These findings underscore the need for multimodal context in auto-completions, leading to smarter, user-aware assistants.",

The authors challenge the assumption that assigning a medical persona consistently improves accuracy or safety, labeling this inconsistency the \"Persona Paradox.\" Key Insights: Non-Monotonic Effects: Assigning a medical persona (like an Emergency Department physician) does not always improve performance. It acts as a behavioral prior that can help in some contexts but hurt in others. The Context Gap: Medical personas improved accuracy and calibration by up to 20% in critical-care tasks (triage) but degraded performance by a similar margin in primary-care settings. Interaction Styles: Adding styles such as \"bold\" or \"cautious\" changes the model’s risk propensity, but these effects vary widely across base models. The Alignment Gap: While \"LLM judges\" preferred medical personas for safety-critical cases, human clinicians were much more skeptical. Human experts showed low confidence in the AI's reasoning quality in 95.9% of cases, despite moderate agreement on safety compliance. Conclusion The study concludes that personas are not \"expertise switches\" but rather priors that introduce context-dependent trade-offs. Relying on personas for clinical safety is risky because they do not provide a universal guarantee of better judgment. Personas should be used with caution in high-stakes medicine, as they can inadvertently trigger biases or performance drops depending on the specific clinical task.",

      "abstract": "As LLM-based agents are increasingly used in long-term interactions, cumulative memory is critical for enabling personalization and maintaining stylistic consistency. However, most existing systems adopt an ``all-or-nothing'' approach to memory usage: incorporating all relevant past information can lead to Memory Anchoring, where the agent is trapped by past interactions, while excluding memory entirely results in under-utilization and the loss of important interaction history. We show that an agent's reliance on memory can be modeled as an explicit and user-controllable dimension. We first introduce a behavioral metric of memory dependence to quantify the influence of past interactions on current outputs. We then propose Steerable Memory Agent, SteeM, a framework that allows users to dynamically regulate memory reliance, ranging from a fresh-start mode that promotes innovation to a high-fidelity mode that closely follows interaction history. Experiments across different scenarios demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms conventional prompting and rigid memory masking strategies, yielding a more nuanced and effective control for personalized human-agent collaboration.",

Training and evaluating agents on complex agentic tasks such as software engineering and computer use requires not only efficient model computation but also sophisticated infrastructure capable of coordinating vast agent-environment interactions. However, no open-source infrastructure can effectively support large-scale training and evaluation on such complex agentic tasks. To address this challenge, we present MegaFlow, a large-scale distributed orchestration system that enables efficient scheduling, resource allocation, and fine-grained task management for agent-environment workloads. MegaFlow abstracts agent training infrastructure into three independent services (Model Service, Agent Service, and Environment Service) that interact through unified interfaces, enabling independent scaling and flexible resource allocation across diverse agent-environment configurations. In our agent training deployments, MegaFlow successfully orchestrates tens of thousands of concurrent agent tasks while maintaining high system stability and achieving efficient resource utilization. By enabling such large-scale agent training, MegaFlow addresses a critical infrastructure gap in the emerging agentic AI landscape.",

      "abstract": "Most current TIR work only focuses on the accuracy of agents in downstream tasks, while lacking calibration of the agents' behavioral patterns in TIR tasks. To address this issue, we first quantitatively analyze several possible erroneous behavioral patterns in current TIR tasks, and classify them into two categories: \"improper tool use\" and \"flawed reasoning logic\". Based on this, we propose ET-Agent, a framework that fully calibrates the behavioral patterns of agents when performing TIR tasks from both data and algorithm levels. On the data side, we propose a self-evolving data flywheel, which enhances the training data by leveraging the agent's own reflective exploration capabilities. On the algorithm side, we propose a behavioral calibration training framework. It performs rejection sampling fine-tuning on the basis of enhanced training data to broaden the agent's exploration of the action space. Subsequently, we implement iterative behavioral calibration reinforcement learning to calibrate the actions of the fine-tuned agent to the optimal behavioral pattern. Our contributions are listed as follows: We provide a comprehensive quantitative analysis of erroneous behavioral patterns in TIR. Inspired by this, we propose ET-Agent, a framework for optimizing TIR's behavioral patterns. We introduce a self-evolving data flywheel, an iterative loop where the model continuously refines its previous trajectories. This mechanism effectively unfolds the model's action space coverage beyond its initial exploration. Based on the flywheel, we present a behavior calibration training framework with two phases, aiming to calibrate the model's exploration in tool-use action space to optimal trajectories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ET-Agent substantially improves behavioral efficiency, reasoning conciseness, and execution success rates while maintaining high accuracy.",

Subsequently, we propose Competitive consensus Chain-of-Thought (CCoT), a multi-path reasoning paradigm that improves the ability of exploring the feasible solution space. To further refine the plan, we integrate a sigmoid-based gating mechanism into the reinforcement learning stage, which dynamically prioritizes soft-constraint satisfaction only after hard constraints are met.

      "abstract": "Current approaches to memory in Large Language Models (LLMs) predominantly rely on static Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which often results in scattered retrieval and fails to capture the structural dependencies required for complex reasoning. For autonomous agents, these passive and flat architectures lack the cognitive organization necessary to model the dynamic and associative nature of long-term interaction. To address this, we propose Structured Episodic Event Memory (SEEM), a hierarchical framework that synergizes a graph memory layer for relational facts with a dynamic episodic memory layer for narrative progression. Grounded in cognitive frame theory, SEEM transforms interaction streams into structured Episodic Event Frames (EEFs) anchored by precise provenance pointers. Furthermore, we introduce an agentic associative fusion and Reverse Provenance Expansion (RPE) mechanism to reconstruct coherent narrative contexts from fragmented evidence. Experimental results on the LoCoMo and LongMemEval benchmarks demonstrate that SEEM significantly outperforms baselines, enabling agents to maintain superior narrative coherence and logical consistency.",

Developers most often describe postponed testing, incomplete adaptation, and limited understanding of AI-generated code, suggesting that AI assistance affects both when and why technical debt emerges.

The lack of structured data on scientific reasoning hinders systematic analysis and development of AI research agents. We introduce Sci-Reasoning, the first dataset capturing the intellectual synthesis behind high-quality AI research. Using community-validated quality signals and an LLM-accelerated, human-verified pipeline, we trace Oral and Spotlight papers across NeurIPS, ICML, and ICLR (2023-2025) to its key predecessors, articulating specific reasoning links in a structured format. Our analysis identifies 15 distinct thinking patterns, with three dominant strategies accounting for 52.7%: Gap-Driven Reframing (24.2%), Cross-Domain Synthesis (18.0%), and Representation Shift (10.5%). The most powerful innovation recipes combine multiple patterns: Gap-Driven Reframing + Representation Shift, Cross-Domain Synthesis + Representation Shift, and Gap-Driven Reframing + Cross-Domain Synthesis. This dataset enables quantitative studies of scientific progress and provides structured reasoning trajectories for training the next generation AI research agents.",

However, how large language models (LLMs) acquire, retain, and forget such concepts during continual pretraining remains poorly understood. In this work, we study how individual concepts are acquired and forgotten, as well as how multiple concepts interact through interference and synergy. We link these behavioral dynamics to LLMs' internal Concept Circuits, computational subgraphs associated with specific concepts, and incorporate Graph Metrics to characterize circuit structure. Our analysis reveals: (1) LLMs concept circuits provide a non-trivial, statistically significant signal of concept learning and forgetting; (2) Concept circuits exhibit a stage-wise temporal pattern during continual pretraining, with an early increase followed by gradual decrease and stabilization; (3) concepts with larger learning gains tend to exhibit greater forgetting under subsequent training; (4) semantically similar concepts induce stronger interference than weakly related ones; (5) conceptual knowledge differs in their transferability, with some significantly facilitating the learning of others. Together, our findings offer a circuit-level view of concept learning dynamics and inform the design of more interpretable and robust concept-aware training strategies for LLMs.",

These two methods have different objectives: SFT minimizes the cross-entropy loss between model outputs and expert responses, while RL maximizes reward signals derived from human preferences or rule-based verifiers. Modern reasoning models have widely adopted the practice of alternating SFT and RL training. However, there is no theoretical account of whether they can be decoupled. We prove that decoupling is impossible in either order: (1) SFT-then-RL coupling: RL increases SFT loss under SFT optimality and (2) RL-then-SFT coupling: SFT lowers the reward achieved by RL. Experiments on Qwen3-0.6B confirm the predicted degradation, verifying that SFT and RL cannot be separated without loss of prior performance in the post-training pipeline.",

Building on this insight, we propose two key contributions: (1) MRN, a normalization method for multi-reward optimization that balances heterogeneous reward signals; and (2) ReFine-RFT, a framework that integrates ensemble rewards with MRN to constrain reasoning length while providing dense, accuracy-oriented feedback.

      "abstract": "This paper introduces FinForge, a novel framework designed to address the scarcity of high-quality, domain-specific datasets for evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) in finance. The authors propose a scalable, semi-synthetic pipeline that combines expert-guided data curation from authoritative sources with controlled question generation and validation using Gemini 2.5 Flash. Key Contributions: FinForge Framework: A hybrid pipeline integrating manual/programmatic corpus construction with rigorous LM-based synthesis. FinForge-5k Dataset: A new snapshot benchmark comprising over 5,000 human-validated Q&A pairs across 11 financial subdomains, derived from a curated corpus of 100,000 verified documents (143M tokens). Benchmarking Results: Evaluation of state-of-the-art open and closed-source models reveals significant variance in financial reasoning capabilities, with leading models achieving approximately 80% accuracy.",

      "abstract": "We ask a question that hasn't been studied before: does inference scaling improve reasoning faithfulness or just accuracy? Self-consistency (majority voting over multiple reasoning paths) reliably boosts LLM accuracy on reasoning tasks. But does getting the right answer more often mean the model is actually reasoning better? We test 4 frontier models (GPT-5.2, Claude Opus 4.5, Gemini-3-flash-preview, and DeepSeek-v3.2) on 100 GSM8K problems and find a surprising tradeoff. Accuracy gains from self-consistency don't necessarily translate to more faithful reasoning. This discovery has important implications for AI safety. We may be building systems that appear smarter without actually reasoning more reliably.",

      "abstract": "Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly deployed in close proximity to humans for applications such as parcel delivery, traffic monitoring, disaster response and infrastructure inspections. Ensuring safe and reliable operation in these human-populated environments demands accurate perception of human poses and actions from an aerial viewpoint. This perspective challenges existing methods with low resolution, steep viewing angles and (self-)occlusion, especially if the application demands realtime feasible models. We train and deploy FlyPose, a lightweight top-down human pose estimation pipeline for aerial imagery. Through multi-dataset training, we achieve an average improvement of 6.8 mAP in person detection across the test-sets of Manipal-UAV, VisDrone, HIT-UAV as well as our custom dataset. For 2D human pose estimation we report an improvement of 16.3 mAP on the challenging UAV-Human dataset. FlyPose runs with an inference latency of ∼20 milliseconds including preprocessing on a Jetson Orin AGX Developer Kit and is deployed onboard a quadrotor UAV during flight experiments. We also publish FlyPose-104, a small but challenging aerial human pose estimation dataset, that includes manual annotations from difficult aerial perspectives: https://github.com/farooqhassaan/FlyPose .",

      "abstract": "Generative spoken language models pretrained on large-scale raw audio can continue a speech prompt with appropriate content while preserving attributes like speaker and emotion, serving as foundation models for spoken dialogue. In prior literature, these models are often evaluated using “global token perplexity”, which directly applies the text perplexity formulation to speech tokens. However, this practice overlooks fundamental differences between speech and text modalities, possibly leading to an underestimation of the speech characteristics. In this work, we propose a variety of likelihood- and generative-based evaluation methods that serve in place of naive global token perplexity. We demonstrate that the proposed evaluations more faithfully reflect perceived generation quality, as evidenced by stronger correlations with human-rated mean opinion scores (MOS). When assessed under the new metrics, the relative performance landscape of spoken language models is reshaped, revealing a significantly reduced gap between the best-performing model and the human topline. Together, these results suggest that appropriate evaluation is critical for accurately assessing progress in spoken language modeling.",

      "abstract": "Video object segmentation methods like SAM2 achieve strong performance through memory-based architectures but struggle under large viewpoint changes due to reliance on appearance features. Traditional 3D instance segmentation methods address viewpoint consistency but require camera poses, depth maps, and expensive preprocessing. We introduce 3AM, a training-time enhancement that integrates 3D-aware features from MUSt3R into SAM2. Our lightweight Feature Merger fuses multi-level MUSt3R features that encode implicit geometric correspondence. Combined with SAM2's appearance features, the model achieves geometry-consistent recognition grounded in both spatial position and visual similarity. We propose a field-of-view aware sampling strategy ensuring frames observe spatially consistent object regions for reliable 3D correspondence learning. Critically, our method requires only RGB input at inference, with no camera poses or preprocessing. On challenging datasets with wide-baseline motion (ScanNet++, Replica), 3AM substantially outperforms SAM2 and extensions, achieving 90.6% IoU and 71.7% Positive IoU on ScanNet++'s Selected Subset, improving over state-of-the-art VOS methods by +15.9 and +30.4 points.",

      "abstract": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines must address challenges beyond simple single-document retrieval, such as interpreting visual elements (tables, charts, images), synthesizing information across documents, and providing accurate source grounding. Existing benchmarks fail to capture this complexity, often focusing on textual data, single-document comprehension, or evaluating retrieval and generation in isolation. We introduce ViDoRe v3, a comprehensive multimodal RAG benchmark featuring multi-type queries over visually rich document corpora. It covers 10 datasets across diverse professional domains, comprising ~26,000 document pages paired with 3,099 human-verified queries, each available in 6 languages. Through 12,000 hours of human annotation effort, we provide high-quality annotations for retrieval relevance, bounding box localization, and verified reference answers. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art RAG pipelines reveals that visual retrievers outperform textual ones, late-interaction models and textual reranking substantially improve performance, and hybrid or purely visual contexts enhance answer generation quality. However, current models still struggle with non-textual elements, open-ended queries, and fine-grained visual grounding. To encourage progress in addressing these challenges, the benchmark is released under a commercially permissive license at https://huggingface.co/vidore .",

      "abstract": "Improving the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) has largely relied on iterative self-training with model-generated data. While effective at boosting accuracy, existing approaches primarily reinforce successful reasoning paths, incurring a substantial calibration cost: models become overconfident and lose the ability to represent uncertainty. This failure has been characterized as a form of model collapse in alignment, where predictive distributions degenerate toward low-variance point estimates. We address this issue by reframing reasoning training as an epistemic learning problem, in which models must learn not only how to reason, but also when their reasoning should be trusted. We propose epistemicallycalibrated reasoning (EPICAR) as a training objective that jointly optimizes reasoning performance and calibration, and instantiate it within an iterative supervised fine-tuning framework using explicit self-evaluation signals. Experiments on Llama-3 and Qwen-3 families demonstrate that our approach achieves Paretosuperiority over standard baselines in both accuracy and calibration, particularly in models with sufficient reasoning capacity (e.g., 3B+). This framework generalizes effectively to OOD mathematical reasoning (GSM8K) and code generation (MBPP). Ultimately, our approach enables a 3× reduction in inference compute, matching the K = 30 performance of STaR with only K = 10 samples in capable models",

      "abstract": "The rapid evolution of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has advanced workflow automation; however, existing research mainly targets performance upper bounds in static environments, overlooking robustness for stochastic real-world deployment. We identify three key challenges: dynamic task scheduling, active exploration under uncertainty, and continuous learning from experience. To bridge this gap, we introduce \\method{}, a dynamic evaluation environment that simulates a \"trainee\" agent continuously exploring a novel setting. Unlike traditional benchmarks, \\method{} evaluates agents along three dimensions: (1) context-aware scheduling for streaming tasks with varying priorities; (2) prudent information acquisition to reduce hallucination via active exploration; and (3) continuous evolution by distilling generalized strategies from rule-based, dynamically generated tasks. Experiments show that cutting-edge agents have significant deficiencies in dynamic environments, especially in active exploration and continual learning. Our work establishes a framework for assessing agent reliability, shifting evaluation from static tests to realistic, production-oriented scenarios.

Existing benchmarks often require annotation-intensive task construction, rely on static evaluation dimensions, or fail to reliably verify facts when citations are missing. To bridge these gaps, we introduce DeepResearchEval, an automated framework for deep research task construction and agentic evaluation. For task construction, we propose a persona-driven pipeline generating realistic, complex research tasks anchored in diverse user profiles, applying a two-stage filter Task Qualification and Search Necessity to retain only tasks requiring multi-source evidence integration and external retrieval. For evaluation, we propose an agentic pipeline with two components: an Adaptive Point-wise Quality Evaluation that dynamically derives task-specific evaluation dimensions, criteria, and weights conditioned on each generated task, and an Active Fact-Checking that autonomously extracts and verifies report statements via web search, even when citations are missing.",

      "abstract": "Large Language Model (LLM) Agents exhibit inherent reasoning abilities through the collaboration of multiple tools. However, during agent inference, existing methods often suffer from (i) locally myopic generation, due to the absence of lookahead, and (ii) trajectory instability, where minor early errors can escalate into divergent reasoning paths. These issues make it difficult to balance global effectiveness and computational efficiency. To address these two issues, we propose meta-adaptive exploration with LLM agents, a meta-adaptive reasoning framework based on LLM Agents that flexibly integrates tool execution and reasoning planning. MAXS employs a lookahead strategy to extend reasoning paths a few steps ahead, estimating the advantage value of tool usage, and combines step consistency variance and inter-step trend slopes to jointly select stable, consistent, and high-value reasoning steps. Additionally, we introduce a trajectory convergence mechanism that controls computational cost by halting further rollouts once path consistency is achieved, enabling a balance between resource efficiency and global effectiveness in multi-tool reasoning. We conduct extensive empirical studies across three base models (MiMo-VL-7B, Qwen2.5-VL-7B, Qwen2.5-VL-32B) and five datasets, demonstrating that MAXS consistently outperforms existing methods in both performance and inference efficiency. Further analysis confirms the effectiveness of our lookahead strategy and tool usage.",

Memory can efficiently reuse knowledge and enhance reasoning consistency and stability. However, existing benchmarks mainly evaluate final answers or step-by-step coherence, overlooking the memory-driven mechanisms that underlie human reasoning, which involves activating anchors and attractors, then integrating them into multi-step inference. To address this gap, we propose A3-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate scientific reasoning through dual-scale memory-driven activation, grounded in Anchor and Attractor Activation. First, we annotate 2,198 science reasoning problems across domains using the SAPM process(subject, anchor & attractor, problem, and memory developing). Second, we introduce a dual-scale memory evaluation framework utilizing anchors and attractors, along with the AAUI(Anchor--Attractor Utilization Index) metric to measure memory activation rates. Finally, through experiments with various base models and paradigms, we validate A3-Bench and analyze how memory activation impacts reasoning performance, providing insights into memory-driven scientific reasoning.",

      "title": "Distribution-Aligned Sequence Distillation for Superior Long-CoT Reasoning",
      "abstract": "In this report, we introduce DASD-4B-Thinking, a lightweight yet highly capable, fully open-source reasoning model. It achieves SOTA performance among open-source models of comparable scale across challenging benchmarks in mathematics, scientific reasoning, and code generation -- even outperforming several larger models. We begin by critically reexamining a widely adopted distillation paradigm in the community: SFT on teacher-generated responses, also known as sequence-level distillation. Although a series of recent works following this scheme have demonstrated remarkable efficiency and strong empirical performance, they are primarily grounded in the SFT perspective. Consequently, these approaches focus predominantly on designing heuristic rules for SFT data filtering, while largely overlooking the core principle of distillation itself -- enabling the student model to learn the teacher's full output distribution so as to inherit its generalization capability. Specifically, we identify three critical limitations in current practice: i) Inadequate representation of the teacher's sequence-level distribution; ii) Misalignment between the teacher's output distribution and the student's learning capacity; and iii) Exposure bias arising from teacher-forced training versus autoregressive inference. In summary, these shortcomings reflect a systemic absence of explicit teacher-student interaction throughout the distillation process, leaving the essence of distillation underexploited. To address these issues, we propose several methodological innovations that collectively form an enhanced sequence-level distillation training pipeline. Remarkably, DASD-4B-Thinking obtains competitive results using only 448K training samples -- an order of magnitude fewer than those employed by most existing open-source efforts. To support community research, we publicly release our models and the training dataset.",

      "abstract": "General-purpose Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), despite their massive scale, often falter in dermatology due to \"diffuse attention\" - the inability to disentangle subtle pathological lesions from background noise. In this paper, we challenge the assumption that parameter scaling is the only path to medical precision. We introduce SkinFlow, a framework that treats diagnosis as an optimization of visual information transmission efficiency. Our approach utilizes a Virtual-Width Dynamic Vision Encoder (DVE) to \"unfold\" complex pathological manifolds without physical parameter expansion, coupled with a two-stage Reinforcement Learning strategy. This strategy sequentially aligns explicit medical descriptions (Stage I) and reconstructs implicit diagnostic textures (Stage II) within a constrained semantic space. Furthermore, we propose a clinically grounded evaluation protocol that prioritizes diagnostic safety and hierarchical relevance over rigid label matching. Empirical results are compelling: our 7B model establishes a new state-of-the-art on the Fitzpatrick17k benchmark, achieving a +12.06% gain in Top-1 accuracy and a +28.57% boost in Top-6 accuracy over the massive general-purpose models (e.g., Qwen3VL-235B and GPT-5.2). These findings demonstrate that optimizing geometric capacity and information flow yields superior diagnostic reasoning compared to raw parameter scaling.",

      "abstract": "OpenDecoder is a novel framework that directly 'opens' the LLM to modify its decoding process within RAG scenarios by leveraging relevance signals from retrieved documents. Through a robustness-oriented training algorithm, the model learns to perform answer decoding guided by explicit indicators, rather than relying solely on prompt engineering or internal attention scores. This approach significantly enhances the system's controllability, accuracy, and robustness across various noisy environments. Take Away: Opening LLM rather than solely relying on prompt engineering is important to improve the system’s robustness, since we cannot expect LLMs’ implicit identification to be always correct. The external indicators, e.g., relevance score, confidence feature, faithful factors, are useful to incorporate with LLMs’ internal information processing mechanism, e.g., attention, for output decoding, where the key problem is to obtain and integrate these indicators into LLMs with a sophisticated training algorithm (during post-training). Experimental results show the robustness enhancement in different levels of noisy environments of our initial investigation of OpenDecoder. An ideal situation is that the LLM can understand to what extent to rely on external retrieved knowledge and internal parametric knowledge during answer decoding.",

We propose ExpSeek, which shifts experience toward step-level proactive seeking: (1) estimating step-level entropy thresholds to determine intervention timing using the model's intrinsic signals; (2) designing step-level tailor-designed experience content. Experiments on Qwen3-8B and 32B models across four challenging web agent benchmarks demonstrate that ExpSeek achieves absolute improvements of 9.3% and 7.5%, respectively. Our experiments validate the feasibility and advantages of entropy as a self-triggering signal, reveal that even a 4B small-scale experience model can significantly boost the performance of larger agent models.",

      "abstract": "DeepSeek got it half right with their mHC paper: stability matters for scaling. But they only measure stability DURING training. What about the stability of what models LEARN? I built Shesha to measure this - a geometric stability metric with SOTA results across AI Safety , Constitutional AI , Model selection , and CRISPR perturbation analysis. The core insight: Most evals check external similarity (does output X match Y?). But imagine a massive library where someone reshuffled all the books. A content-based audit would say that nothing's wrong since the inventory is identical. But the library is useless since nothing can be found. That's the gap Shesha fills. The implications are broad with SOTA results across 4 domains : AI Safety - Shesha is the best canary in the coal mine . Shesha outperforms CKA and Procrustes on drift detection. Detects 2x more drift than CKA, triggers earlier 73% of the time, catches subtle LoRA shifts at 90% sensitivity (5% FPR) - with only 7% false alarms vs Procrustes' 44%. Constitutional AI - Shesha provides the best steering prediction . Constitutional AI needs models you can actually steer. Most metrics ask: \"Are classes separable?\" Wrong question! Shesha asks: \"Is that separation STABLE under perturbation?\" Tested on 35-69 embedding models across 3 experiments. Shesha outperforms Fisher discriminant, silhouette score, Procrustes, and anisotropy. The correlations with intervention success are rho=0.89-0.96, and the partial correlations after controlling for separability are rho=0.67-0.76. Stability ≠ separability. Model selection - Shesha exposes what LogME misses . The DINO Paradox - best transfer scores, worst geometric stability. Tested 94 vision models on 6 datasets: DINOv2 ranked #1 in LogME on 4/6 datasets but last or near last in stability on 5/6. SOTA transfer incurs a \"geometric tax.\" CRISPR perturbations - Shesha serves as a new filter for target selection . CRISPR screens find hits by magnitude, but magnitude alone can't distinguish clean lineage drivers from promiscuous regulators. Shesha adds precision. Tested on 811 perturbations, Shesha showed uniformly positive magnitude-stability correlations ranging from rho=0.746 in high-variance screens to rho=0.963 in cleaner activation settings. Notably, in discordant cases, Shesha separates KLF1 (stable, specific) from CEBPA (strong but messy) purely from geometry. Additional validation in neuroscience: Geometric stability predicted neural-behavioral coupling (rho=0.18, p=0.005) in Neuropixels data. Centroid drift showed no relationship (rho=0.00). Stability ≠ consistency.

Current methods lack explicit mechanisms for guiding diverse exploration and instead prioritize optimization efficiency and performance over diversity. This paper proposes an RL framework structured around a semi-structured long Chain-of-Thought (CoT), in which the generation process is decomposed into explicitly planned intermediate steps. We introduce a Diverse Planning Branching method that strategically introduces divergence at the planning phase based on diversity variation, alongside a group-aware diversity reward to encourage distinct trajectories.

      "abstract": "Critique-guided reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for training LLM agents by augmenting sparse outcome rewards with natural-language feedback. However, current methods often rely on static or offline critic models, which fail to adapt as the policy evolves. In on-policy RL, the agent's error patterns shift over time, causing stationary critics to become stale and providing feedback of diminishing utility. To address this, we introduce ECHO (Evolving Critic for Hindsight-Guided Optimization)}, a framework that jointly optimizes the policy and critic through a synchronized co-evolutionary loop. ECHO utilizes a cascaded rollout mechanism where the critic generates multiple diagnoses for an initial trajectory, followed by policy refinement to enable group-structured advantage estimation. We address the challenge of learning plateaus via a saturation-aware gain shaping objective, which rewards the critic for inducing incremental improvements in high-performing trajectories. By employing dual-track GRPO updates, ECHO ensures the critic's feedback stays synchronized with the evolving policy. Experimental results show that ECHO yields more stable training and higher long-horizon task success across open-world environments.",

This paper introduces a semantic, intent-driven scheduling paradigm for cluster systems using Natural Language Processing. The system employs a Large Language Model (LLM) integrated via a Kubernetes scheduler extender to interpret natural language allocation hint annotations for soft affinity preferences. A prototype featuring a cluster state cache and an intent analyzer (using AWS Bedrock) was developed. Empirical evaluation demonstrated high LLM parsing accuracy (>95% Subset Accuracy on an evaluation ground-truth dataset) for top-tier models like Amazon Nova Pro/Premier and Mistral Pixtral Large, significantly outperforming a baseline engine. Scheduling quality tests across six scenarios showed the prototype achieved superior or equivalent placement compared to standard Kubernetes configurations, particularly excelling in complex and quantitative scenarios and handling conflicting soft preferences. The results validate using LLMs for accessible scheduling but highlight limitations like synchronous LLM latency, suggesting asynchronous processing for production readiness. This work confirms the viability of semantic soft affinity for simplifying workload orchestration.",

We introduce SampoNLP, a corpus-free toolkit for morphological lexicon creation using MDL-inspired Self-Referential Atomicity Scoring, which filters composite forms through internal structural cues - suited for low-resource settings. Using the high-purity lexicons generated by SampoNLP for Finnish, Hungarian, and Estonian, we conduct a systematic evaluation of BPE tokenizers across a range of vocabulary sizes (8k-256k). We propose a unified metric, the Integrated Performance Score (IPS), to navigate the trade-off between morpheme coverage and over-splitting. By analyzing the IPS curves, we identify the \"elbow points\" of diminishing returns and provide the first empirically grounded recommendations for optimal vocabulary sizes (k) in these languages. Our study not only offers practical guidance but also quantitatively demonstrates the limitations of standard BPE for highly agglutinative languages.

      "abstract": "Vision-Language Pre-training (VLP) models demonstrate strong performance across various downstream tasks by learning from large-scale image-text pairs through contrastive pretraining. The release of extensive English image-text datasets (e.g., COYO-700M and LAION-400M) has enabled widespread adoption of models such as CLIP and SigLIP in tasks including cross-modal retrieval and image captioning. However, the advancement of Chinese vision-language pretraining has substantially lagged behind, due to the scarcity of high-quality Chinese image-text data. To address this gap, we develop a comprehensive pipeline for constructing a high-quality Chinese cross-modal dataset. As a result, we propose DanQing, which contains 100 million image-text pairs collected from Common Crawl. Different from existing datasets, DanQing is curated through a more rigorous selection process, yielding superior data quality. Moreover, DanQing is primarily built from 2024-2025 web data, enabling models to better capture evolving semantic trends and thus offering greater practical utility. We compare DanQing with existing datasets by continual pre-training of the SigLIP2 model. Experimental results show that DanQing consistently achieves superior performance across a range of Chinese downstream tasks, including zero-shot classification, cross-modal retrieval, and LMM-based evaluations. To facilitate further research in Chinese vision-language pre-training, we will open-source the DanQing dataset under the Creative Common CC-BY 4.0 license.",

      "title": "MatchTIR: Fine-Grained Supervision for Tool-Integrated Reasoning via Bipartite Matching",
      "abstract": "💡 Overview We propose MatchTIR, a fine-grained reinforcement learning framework specifically designed for Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR). The core principle of MatchTIR is to introduce precise supervision via bipartite matching-based turn-level reward assignment, allowing the model to distinguish between effective, redundant, or erroneous tool calls in multi-turn scenarios. 🔥Key Insights We highlight that existing RL methods assign uniform advantages to all steps, failing to distinguish between critical, redundant, or erroneous tool calls in long-horizon trajectories. We reformulate credit assignment as a bipartite matching problem between predicted and ground-truth tool calls. By constructing a matching matrix, we get the precise reward. We introduce two matching mechanisms: Hard Assignment (KM algorithm) for strict one-to-one mapping and Soft Assignment (Optimal Transport) for probabilistic alignment, providing dense and verifiable supervision signals. To balance local precision with global success, we propose a scheme that integrates trajectory-level signals (overall quality) with turn-level advantages (individual step contribution via discounted rewards). Extensive experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of MatchTIR. Notably, our 4B model outperforms larger 8B competitors, particularly in long-horizon and multi-turn tasks. 🔧✨ All the code, datasets and model checkpoints of MatchTIR are fully open-sourced: Github: https://github.com/quchangle1/MatchTIR Datasets & Models: https://huggingface.co/collections/ChangleQu/matchtir",

      "abstract": "The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has produced substantial gains in reasoning, perception, and generative capability across language and vision. However, whether these advances yield commensurate improvements in safety remains unclear, in part due to fragmented evaluation practices limited to single modalities or threat models. In this report, we present an integrated safety evaluation of 7 frontier models: GPT-5.2, Gemini 3 Pro, Qwen3-VL, Doubao 1.8, Grok 4.1 Fast, Nano Banana Pro, and Seedream 4.5. We evaluate each model across language, vision-language, and image generation settings using a unified protocol that integrates benchmark evaluation, adversarial evaluation, multilingual evaluation, and compliance evaluation. Aggregating our evaluations into safety leaderboards and model safety profiles across multiple evaluation modes reveals a sharply heterogeneous safety landscape. While GPT-5.2 demonstrates consistently strong and balanced safety performance across evaluations, other models exhibit pronounced trade-offs among benchmark safety, adversarial alignment, multilingual generalization, and regulatory compliance. Both language and vision-language modalities show significant vulnerability under adversarial evaluation, with all models degrading substantially despite strong results on standard benchmarks. Text-to-image models achieve relatively stronger alignment in regulated visual risk categories, yet remain brittle under adversarial or semantically ambiguous prompts. Overall, these results show that safety in frontier models is inherently multidimensional--shaped by modality, language, and evaluation scheme, underscoring the need for standardized safety evaluations to accurately assess real-world risk and guide responsible model development and deployment.",

      "abstract": "Generating molecules that satisfy precise numeric constraints over multiple physicochemical properties is critical and challenging. Although large language models (LLMs) are expressive, they struggle with precise multiobjective control and numeric reasoning without external structure and feedback. We introduce M4olGen, a fragment-level, retrievalaugmented, two-stage framework for molecule generation under multi-property constraints.Stage I: Prototype generation: a multiagent reasoner performs retrieval-anchored, fragment-level edits to produce a candidate near the feasible region. Stage II: RL-based fine-grained optimization: a fragment-level optimizer trained with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) applies one- or multihop refinements to explicitly minimize the property errors toward our target while regulating edit complexity and deviation from the prototype. A large, automatically curated dataset with reasoning chains of fragment edits and measured property deltas underpins both stages, enabling deterministic, reproducible supervision and controllable multi-hop reasoning. Unlike prior work, our framework better reasons about molecules by leveraging fragments and supports controllable refinement toward numeric targets. Experiments on generation under two sets of property constraints (QED, LogP, Molecular Weight and HOMO, LUMO) show consistent gains in validity and precise satisfaction of multi-property targets, outperforming strong LLMs and graph-based algorithms.",

      "abstract": "We present a family of open-source Music Foundation Models designed to advance large-scale music understanding and generation across diverse tasks and modalities. Our framework consists of four major components: (1) HeartCLAP, an audio\u0002text alignment model; (2) HeartTranscriptor, a robust lyric recognition model optimized for real-world music scenarios; and (3) HeartCodec, a low-frame-rate (12.5 Hz) yet high-fidelity music codec tokenizer that captures long-range musical structure while preserving fine-grained acoustic details and enabling efficient autoregressive modeling; (4) HeartMuLa, an LLM-based song generation model capable of synthesizing high-fidelity music under rich, user-controllable conditions (e.g., textual style descriptions, lyrics, and reference audio). In addition, it provides two specialized modes: (i) fine-grained musical attribute control, which allows users to specify the style of different song sections (e.g., intro, verse, chorus) using natural language prompts; and (ii) short, engaging music generation, which is suitable as background music for short videos. Lastly, HeartMuLa improves significantly when scaled to 7B parameters. For the first time, we show that a Suno-level, commercial-grade system can be reproduced using academic-scale data and GPU resources. We expect these foundation models to serve as strong baselines for future research and to facilitate practical applications in multimodal content production.",

      "title": "PRL: Process Reward Learning Improves LLMs' Reasoning Ability and Broadens the Reasoning Boundary",
      "abstract": "Abstract Improving the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) has been a continuous topic recently. But most relevant works are based on outcome rewards at the trajectory level, missing fine-grained supervision during the reasoning process. Other existing training frameworks that try to combine process signals together to optimize LLMs also rely heavily on tedious additional steps like MCTS, training a separate reward model, etc., doing harm to the training efficiency. Moreover, the intuition behind the process signals design lacks rigorous theoretical support, leaving the understanding of the optimization mechanism opaque. In this paper, we propose Process Reward Learning (PRL), which decomposes the entropy regularized reinforcement learning objective into intermediate steps, with rigorous process rewards that could be assigned to models accordingly. Starting from theoretical motivation, we derive the formulation of PRL that is essentially equivalent to the objective of reward maximization plus a KL-divergence penalty term between the policy model and a reference model. However, PRL could turn the outcome reward into process supervision signals, which helps better guide the exploration during RL optimization. From our experiment results, we demonstrate that PRL not only improves the average performance for LLMs' reasoning ability measured by average @ n, but also broadens the reasoning boundary by improving the pass @ n metric. Extensive experiments show that the effectiveness of PRL could be verified and generalized.",

      "abstract": "Really interesting and timely work—agent “skills” seem like a rapidly growing supply-chain attack surface, and it’s refreshing to see a large-scale empirical analysis rather than a purely conceptual treatment. The scale and methodology (tens of thousands of skills analyzed using a combined static and LLM-based pipeline) are particularly compelling, and the 14-pattern, four-category vulnerability taxonomy helps make the risk landscape much more concrete. The reported numbers are striking: roughly a quarter of skills containing vulnerabilities, with a non-trivial fraction exhibiting high-severity patterns suggestive of malicious behavior, which strongly motivates the need for better ecosystem defenses. It would be interesting to learn more about how ambiguous cases were handled when separating malicious intent from accidental insecurity, whether vulnerability prevalence differs across marketplaces with different governance models, and how developers might practically use the detection results for remediation. The call for capability-based permission systems is persuasive, and additional discussion of concrete enforcement mechanisms (e.g., sandboxing, least-privilege access, signing, or dependency controls) would further strengthen the practical impact.",

      "abstract": "We present WildRayZer, a self-supervised framework for novel view synthesis (NVS) in dynamic environments where both the camera and objects move. Dynamic content breaks the multi-view consistency that static NVS models rely on, leading to ghosting, hallucinated geometry, and unstable pose estimation. WildRayZer addresses this by performing an analysis-by-synthesis test: a camera-only static renderer explains rigid structure, and its residuals reveal transient regions. From these residuals, we construct pseudo motion masks, distill a motion estimator, and use it to mask input tokens and gate loss gradients so supervision focuses on cross-view background completion. To enable large-scale training and evaluation, we curate Dynamic RealEstate10K (D-RE10K), a real-world dataset of 15K casually captured dynamic sequences, and D-RE10K-iPhone, a paired transient and clean benchmark for sparse-view transient-aware NVS. Experiments show that WildRayZer consistently outperforms optimization-based and feed-forward baselines in both transient-region removal and full-frame NVS quality with a single feed-forward pass.",

In this paper, we demystify the emergence of these Slash-Dominant Heads (SDHs) from both empirical and theoretical perspectives. First, by analyzing open-source LLMs, we find that SDHs are intrinsic to models and generalize to out-of-distribution prompts. To explain the intrinsic emergence, we analyze the queries, keys, and Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE), which jointly determine attention scores. Our empirical analysis reveals two characteristic conditions of SDHs: (1) Queries and keys are almost rank-one, and (2) RoPE is dominated by medium- and high-frequency components. Under these conditions, queries and keys are nearly identical across tokens, and interactions between medium- and high-frequency components of RoPE give rise to SDHs. Beyond empirical evidence, we theoretically show that these conditions are sufficient to ensure the emergence of SDHs by formalizing them as our modeling assumptions. Particularly, we analyze the training dynamics of a shallow Transformer equipped with RoPE under these conditions, and prove that models trained via gradient descent exhibit SDHs. The SDHs generalize to out-of-distribution prompts.",

      "title": "Memory Bank Compression for Continual Adaptation of Large Language Models",
      "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have become a mainstay for many everyday applications. However, as data evolve their knowledge quickly becomes outdated. Continual learning aims to update LLMs with new information without erasing previously acquired knowledge. Although methods such as full fine-tuning can incorporate new data, they are computationally expensive and prone to catastrophic forgetting, where prior knowledge is overwritten. Memory-augmented approaches address this by equipping LLMs with a memory bank, that is an external memory module which stores information for future use. However, these methods face a critical limitation, in particular, the memory bank constantly grows in the real-world scenario when large-scale data streams arrive. In this paper, we propose MBC, a model that compresses the memory bank through a codebook optimization strategy during online adaptation learning. To ensure stable learning, we also introduce an online resetting mechanism that prevents codebook collapse. In addition, we employ Key-Value Low-Rank Adaptation in the attention layers of the LLM, enabling efficient utilization of the compressed memory representations. Experiments with benchmark question-answering datasets demonstrate that MBC reduces the memory bank size to 0.3% when compared against the most competitive baseline, while maintaining high retention accuracy during online adaptation learning.

      "abstract": "Vision-Language Pre-training (VLP) models demonstrate strong performance across various downstream tasks by learning from large-scale image-text pairs through contrastive pretraining. The release of extensive English image-text datasets (e.g., COYO-700M and LAION-400M) has enabled widespread adoption of models such as CLIP and SigLIP in tasks including cross-modal retrieval and image captioning. However, the advancement of Chinese vision-language pretraining has substantially lagged behind, due to the scarcity of high-quality Chinese image-text data. To address this gap, we develop a comprehensive pipeline for constructing a high-quality Chinese cross-modal dataset. As a result, we propose DanQing, which contains 100 million image-text pairs collected from Common Crawl. Different from existing datasets, DanQing is curated through a more rigorous selection process, yielding superior data quality. Moreover, DanQing is primarily built from 2024-2025 web data, enabling models to better capture evolving semantic trends and thus offering greater practical utility. We compare DanQing with existing datasets by continual pre-training of the SigLIP2 model. Experimental results show that DanQing consistently achieves superior performance across a range of Chinese downstream tasks, including zero-shot classification, cross-modal retrieval, and LMM-based evaluations. To facilitate further research in Chinese vision-language pre-training, we will open-source the DanQing dataset under the Creative Common CC-BY 4.0 license.",

      "abstract": "💡 Overview We propose MatchTIR, a fine-grained reinforcement learning framework specifically designed for Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR). The core principle of MatchTIR is to introduce precise supervision via bipartite matching-based turn-level reward assignment, allowing the model to distinguish between effective, redundant, or erroneous tool calls in multi-turn scenarios. 🔥Key Insights We highlight that existing RL methods assign uniform advantages to all steps, failing to distinguish between critical, redundant, or erroneous tool calls in long-horizon trajectories. We reformulate credit assignment as a bipartite matching problem between predicted and ground-truth tool calls. By constructing a matching matrix, we get the precise reward. We introduce two matching mechanisms: Hard Assignment (KM algorithm) for strict one-to-one mapping and Soft Assignment (Optimal Transport) for probabilistic alignment, providing dense and verifiable supervision signals. To balance local precision with global success, we propose a scheme that integrates trajectory-level signals (overall quality) with turn-level advantages (individual step contribution via discounted rewards). Extensive experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of MatchTIR. Notably, our 4B model outperforms larger 8B competitors, particularly in long-horizon and multi-turn tasks. 🔧✨ All the code, datasets and model checkpoints of MatchTIR are fully open-sourced: Github: https://github.com/quchangle1/MatchTIR Datasets & Models: https://huggingface.co/collections/ChangleQu/matchtir",

      "abstract": "The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has produced substantial gains in reasoning, perception, and generative capability across language and vision. However, whether these advances yield commensurate improvements in safety remains unclear, in part due to fragmented evaluation practices limited to single modalities or threat models. In this report, we present an integrated safety evaluation of 7 frontier models: GPT-5.2, Gemini 3 Pro, Qwen3-VL, Doubao 1.8, Grok 4.1 Fast, Nano Banana Pro, and Seedream 4.5. We evaluate each model across language, vision-language, and image generation settings using a unified protocol that integrates benchmark evaluation, adversarial evaluation, multilingual evaluation, and compliance evaluation. Aggregating our evaluations into safety leaderboards and model safety profiles across multiple evaluation modes reveals a sharply heterogeneous safety landscape. While GPT-5.2 demonstrates consistently strong and balanced safety performance across evaluations, other models exhibit pronounced trade-offs among benchmark safety, adversarial alignment, multilingual generalization, and regulatory compliance. Both language and vision-language modalities show significant vulnerability under adversarial evaluation, with all models degrading substantially despite strong results on standard benchmarks. Text-to-image models achieve relatively stronger alignment in regulated visual risk categories, yet remain brittle under adversarial or semantically ambiguous prompts. Overall, these results show that safety in frontier models is inherently multidimensional--shaped by modality, language, and evaluation scheme, underscoring the need for standardized safety evaluations to accurately assess real-world risk and guide responsible model development and deployment.",

      "abstract": "Generating molecules that satisfy precise numeric constraints over multiple physicochemical properties is critical and challenging. Although large language models (LLMs) are expressive, they struggle with precise multiobjective control and numeric reasoning without external structure and feedback. We introduce M4olGen, a fragment-level, retrievalaugmented, two-stage framework for molecule generation under multi-property constraints.Stage I: Prototype generation: a multiagent reasoner performs retrieval-anchored, fragment-level edits to produce a candidate near the feasible region. Stage II: RL-based fine-grained optimization: a fragment-level optimizer trained with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) applies one- or multihop refinements to explicitly minimize the property errors toward our target while regulating edit complexity and deviation from the prototype. A large, automatically curated dataset with reasoning chains of fragment edits and measured property deltas underpins both stages, enabling deterministic, reproducible supervision and controllable multi-hop reasoning. Unlike prior work, our framework better reasons about molecules by leveraging fragments and supports controllable refinement toward numeric targets. Experiments on generation under two sets of property constraints (QED, LogP, Molecular Weight and HOMO, LUMO) show consistent gains in validity and precise satisfaction of multi-property targets, outperforming strong LLMs and graph-based algorithms.",

      "abstract": "We present a family of open-source Music Foundation Models designed to advance large-scale music understanding and generation across diverse tasks and modalities. Our framework consists of four major components: (1) HeartCLAP, an audio\u0002text alignment model; (2) HeartTranscriptor, a robust lyric recognition model optimized for real-world music scenarios; and (3) HeartCodec, a low-frame-rate (12.5 Hz) yet high-fidelity music codec tokenizer that captures long-range musical structure while preserving fine-grained acoustic details and enabling efficient autoregressive modeling; (4) HeartMuLa, an LLM-based song generation model capable of synthesizing high-fidelity music under rich, user-controllable conditions (e.g., textual style descriptions, lyrics, and reference audio). In addition, it provides two specialized modes: (i) fine-grained musical attribute control, which allows users to specify the style of different song sections (e.g., intro, verse, chorus) using natural language prompts; and (ii) short, engaging music generation, which is suitable as background music for short videos. Lastly, HeartMuLa improves significantly when scaled to 7B parameters. For the first time, we show that a Suno-level, commercial-grade system can be reproduced using academic-scale data and GPU resources. We expect these foundation models to serve as strong baselines for future research and to facilitate practical applications in multimodal content production.",

      "title": "PRL: Process Reward Learning Improves LLMs' Reasoning Ability and Broadens the Reasoning Boundary",
      "abstract": "Abstract Improving the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) has been a continuous topic recently. But most relevant works are based on outcome rewards at the trajectory level, missing fine-grained supervision during the reasoning process. Other existing training frameworks that try to combine process signals together to optimize LLMs also rely heavily on tedious additional steps like MCTS, training a separate reward model, etc., doing harm to the training efficiency. Moreover, the intuition behind the process signals design lacks rigorous theoretical support, leaving the understanding of the optimization mechanism opaque. In this paper, we propose Process Reward Learning (PRL), which decomposes the entropy regularized reinforcement learning objective into intermediate steps, with rigorous process rewards that could be assigned to models accordingly. Starting from theoretical motivation, we derive the formulation of PRL that is essentially equivalent to the objective of reward maximization plus a KL-divergence penalty term between the policy model and a reference model. However, PRL could turn the outcome reward into process supervision signals, which helps better guide the exploration during RL optimization. From our experiment results, we demonstrate that PRL not only improves the average performance for LLMs' reasoning ability measured by average @ n, but also broadens the reasoning boundary by improving the pass @ n metric. Extensive experiments show that the effectiveness of PRL could be verified and generalized.",

The scale and methodology (tens of thousands of skills analyzed using a combined static and LLM-based pipeline) are particularly compelling, and the 14-pattern, four-category vulnerability taxonomy helps make the risk landscape much more concrete. The reported numbers are striking: roughly a quarter of skills containing vulnerabilities, with a non-trivial fraction exhibiting high-severity patterns suggestive of malicious behavior, which strongly motivates the need for better ecosystem defenses. It would be interesting to learn more about how ambiguous cases were handled when separating malicious intent from accidental insecurity, whether vulnerability prevalence differs across marketplaces with different governance models, and how developers might practically use the detection results for remediation. The call for capability-based permission systems is persuasive, and additional discussion of concrete enforcement mechanisms (e.g., sandboxing, least-privilege access, signing, or dependency controls) would further strengthen the practical impact.",

We built the first system-level defense to sandbox these agents, and the results challenged our assumptions about AI.

      "abstract": "We present WildRayZer, a self-supervised framework for novel view synthesis (NVS) in dynamic environments where both the camera and objects move. Dynamic content breaks the multi-view consistency that static NVS models rely on, leading to ghosting, hallucinated geometry, and unstable pose estimation. WildRayZer addresses this by performing an analysis-by-synthesis test: a camera-only static renderer explains rigid structure, and its residuals reveal transient regions. From these residuals, we construct pseudo motion masks, distill a motion estimator, and use it to mask input tokens and gate loss gradients so supervision focuses on cross-view background completion. To enable large-scale training and evaluation, we curate Dynamic RealEstate10K (D-RE10K), a real-world dataset of 15K casually captured dynamic sequences, and D-RE10K-iPhone, a paired transient and clean benchmark for sparse-view transient-aware NVS. Experiments show that WildRayZer consistently outperforms optimization-based and feed-forward baselines in both transient-region removal and full-frame NVS quality with a single feed-forward pass.",

      "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit slash attention patterns, where attention scores concentrate along the Δ-th sub-diagonal for some offset Δ. These patterns play a key role in passing information across tokens. But why do they emerge? In this paper, we demystify the emergence of these Slash-Dominant Heads (SDHs) from both empirical and theoretical perspectives. First, by analyzing open-source LLMs, we find that SDHs are intrinsic to models and generalize to out-of-distribution prompts. To explain the intrinsic emergence, we analyze the queries, keys, and Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE), which jointly determine attention scores. Our empirical analysis reveals two characteristic conditions of SDHs: (1) Queries and keys are almost rank-one, and (2) RoPE is dominated by medium- and high-frequency components. Under these conditions, queries and keys are nearly identical across tokens, and interactions between medium- and high-frequency components of RoPE give rise to SDHs. Beyond empirical evidence, we theoretically show that these conditions are sufficient to ensure the emergence of SDHs by formalizing them as our modeling assumptions. Particularly, we analyze the training dynamics of a shallow Transformer equipped with RoPE under these conditions, and prove that models trained via gradient descent exhibit SDHs. The SDHs generalize to out-of-distribution prompts.",

      "title": "Memory Bank Compression for Continual Adaptation of Large Language Models",
      "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have become a mainstay for many everyday applications. However, as data evolve their knowledge quickly becomes outdated. Continual learning aims to update LLMs with new information without erasing previously acquired knowledge. Although methods such as full fine-tuning can incorporate new data, they are computationally expensive and prone to catastrophic forgetting, where prior knowledge is overwritten. Memory-augmented approaches address this by equipping LLMs with a memory bank, that is an external memory module which stores information for future use. However, these methods face a critical limitation, in particular, the memory bank constantly grows in the real-world scenario when large-scale data streams arrive. In this paper, we propose MBC, a model that compresses the memory bank through a codebook optimization strategy during online adaptation learning. To ensure stable learning, we also introduce an online resetting mechanism that prevents codebook collapse. In addition, we employ Key-Value Low-Rank Adaptation in the attention layers of the LLM, enabling efficient utilization of the compressed memory representations. Experiments with benchmark question-answering datasets demonstrate that MBC reduces the memory bank size to 0.3% when compared against the most competitive baseline, while maintaining high retention accuracy during online adaptation learning.
