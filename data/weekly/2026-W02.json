We present RL-AWB, a novel framework combining statistical methods with deep reinforcement learning for nighttime white balance. Our method begins with a statistical algorithm tailored for nighttime scenes, integrating salient gray pixel detection with novel illumination estimation. Building on this foundation, we develop the first deep reinforcement learning approach for color constancy that leverages the statistical algorithm as its core, mimicking professional AWB tuning experts by dynamically optimizing parameters for each image. To facilitate cross-sensor evaluation, we introduce the first multi-sensor nighttime dataset.

      "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) for complex reasoning is often hindered by high computational costs and latency, while resource-efficient Small Language Models (SLMs) typically lack the necessary reasoning capacity. Existing collaborative approaches, such as cascading or routing, operate at a coarse granularity by offloading entire queries to LLMs, resulting in significant computational waste when the SLM is capable of handling the majority of reasoning steps. To address this, we propose RelayLLM, a novel framework for efficient reasoning via token-level collaborative decoding. Unlike routers, RelayLLM empowers the SLM to act as an active controller that dynamically invokes the LLM only for critical tokens via a special command, effectively \"relaying\" the generation process. We introduce a two-stage training framework, including warm-up and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to teach the model to balance independence with strategic help-seeking. Empirical results across six benchmarks demonstrate that RelayLLM achieves an average accuracy of 49.52%, effectively bridging the performance gap between the two models. Notably, this is achieved by invoking the LLM for only 1.07% of the total generated tokens, offering a 98.2% cost reduction compared to performance-matched random routers.",

      "abstract": "Abstract LLM agents have emerged as powerful systems for tackling multi-turn tasks by interleaving internal reasoning and external tool interactions. Agentic Reinforcement Learning has recently drawn significant research attention as a critical post-training paradigm to further refine these capabilities. In this paper, we present AT 2 PO (Agentic Turn-based Policy Optimization via Tree Search), a unified framework for multi-turn agentic RL that addresses three core challenges: limited exploration diversity, sparse credit assignment, and misaligned policy optimization. AT 2 PO introduces a turn-level tree structure that jointly enables Entropy-Guided Tree Expansion for strategic exploration and Turn-wise Credit Assignment for fine-grained reward propagation from sparse outcomes. Complementing this, we propose Agentic Turn-based Policy Optimization, a turn-level learning objective that aligns policy updates with the natural decision granularity of agentic interactions. ATPO is orthogonal to tree search and can be readily integrated into any multi-turn RL pipeline. Experiments across seven benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements over the state-of-the-art baseline by up to 1.84 percentage points in average, with ablation studies validating the effectiveness of each component.

      "abstract": "Vision-language models (VLMs) achieve remarkable performance but remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Entropy, a measure of model uncertainty, is strongly correlated with the reliability of VLM. Prior entropy-based attacks maximize uncertainty at all decoding steps, implicitly assuming that every token contributes equally to generation instability. We show instead that a small fraction (about 20%) of high-entropy tokens, i.e., critical decision points in autoregressive generation, disproportionately governs output trajectories. By concentrating adversarial perturbations on these positions, we achieve semantic degradation comparable to global methods while using substantially smaller budgets. More importantly, across multiple representative VLMs, such selective attacks convert 35-49% of benign outputs into harmful ones, exposing a more critical safety risk. Remarkably, these vulnerable high-entropy forks recur across architecturally diverse VLMs, enabling feasible transferability (17-26% harmful rates on unseen targets). Motivated by these findings, we propose Entropy-bank Guided Adversarial attacks (EGA), which achieves competitive attack success rates (93-95%) alongside high harmful conversion, thereby revealing new weaknesses in current VLM safety mechanisms.",

      "abstract": "Mixture of Experts models are widely assumed to achieve domain specialization through sparse routing. In this work, we question this assumption by introducing COMMITTEEAUDIT, a post hoc framework that analyzes routing behavior at the level of expert groups rather than individual experts. Across three representative models and the MMLU benchmark, we uncover a domain-invariant Standing Committee. This is a compact coalition of routed experts that consistently captures the majority of routing mass across domains, layers, and routing budgets, even when architectures already include shared experts. Qualitative analysis further shows that Standing Committees anchor reasoning structure and syntax, while peripheral experts handle domain-specific knowledge. These findings reveal a strong structural bias toward centralized computation, suggesting that specialization in Mixture of Experts models is far less pervasive than commonly believed. This inherent bias also indicates that current training objectives, such as load-balancing losses that enforce uniform expert utilization, may be working against the model's natural optimization path, thereby limiting training efficiency and performance.",

To enable end-to-end training of such agents, we introduce an Exploration-then-Synthesis data synthesis pipeline that addresses the scarcity of high-quality training data for DocQA. Training on the synthesized data, the trained models on two long-context document understanding benchmarks, MMLongBench-Doc and DocBench, show their effectiveness. Further analysis provides valuable insights for the agentic tool design and synthetic data.",

Our paper presents a novel pipeline to convert pretrained video diffusion models (like Wan2.1-1.3B) into efficient pyramidal ones via low-cost finetuning. Key Innovations: Efficiency via Hierarchy: We restructure the diffusion process into three spatiotemporal stages, processing high noise at lower resolutions to significantly reduce inference costs. Theoretical Generalization: We extended resolution transitions to a broader class of upsampling/downsampling functions based on orthogonal transforms. Step Distillation: A systematic study of distillation techniques for pyramidal setups, including the first successful training of Pyramidal Patchification models for few-step generation. Key Insights & Results: Near-Original Quality: Achieves video quality comparable to the original Wan model while requiring significantly less compute. Superior Motion: Our recommended recipe, PyramidalWan-DMD-PT*, provides consistent motion and fills the gap for high-performing few-step inference. Artifact Reduction: Unlike training-free acceleration methods (e.g., Jenga), our approach avoids severe scene and motion artifacts.",

By combining multi-resolution drafting with spatially informed verification, we achieve substantial speedups of up to 1.7x while maintaining high perceptual quality and semantic alignment. The Core Idea: Unlike standard methods that use raster-scan rejection, MuLo-SD exploits the spatial structure of images. We propose candidate tokens using a low-resolution drafter and a learned up-sampler, which are then verified in parallel by a high-resolution target model. Key Innovation: Local Verification 🔍 Crucially, we introduced a local rejection and resampling mechanism. Instead of discarding every token after a single error, we correct errors by focusing only on the spatial neighborhoods of rejected tokens, significantly boosting efficiency. Results at a Glance: ✅ Outperforms strong baselines like EAGLE-2 and LANTERN. ✅ Consistently delivers greater speedups across 512p and 1024p resolutions. ✅ Integrates seamlessly with unified Multimodal LLMs. 🔗 https://qualcomm-ai-research.github.io/mulo-sd-webpage",

We introduce a dense correspondence-guided pre-registration phase that initializes Gaussians with accurate geometry while jointly constructing 3D Context Proposals via cross-view clustering. Each proposal carries a global feature obtained through weighted aggregation of member embeddings, and this feature is fused onto Gaussians during direct registration to maintain per-primitive language coherence across views.

      "abstract": "Soft boundaries, like thin hairs, are commonly observed in natural and computer-generated imagery, but they remain challenging for 3D vision due to the ambiguous mixing of foreground and background cues. This paper introduces Guardians of the Hair (HairGuard), a framework designed to recover fine-grained soft boundary details in 3D vision tasks. Specifically, we first propose a novel data curation pipeline that leverages image matting datasets for training and design a depth fixer network to automatically identify soft boundary regions. With a gated residual module, the depth fixer refines depth precisely around soft boundaries while maintaining global depth quality, allowing plug-and-play integration with state-of-the-art depth models. For view synthesis, we perform depth-based forward warping to retain high-fidelity textures, followed by a generative scene painter that fills disoccluded regions and eliminates redundant background artifacts within soft boundaries. Finally, a color fuser adaptively combines warped and inpainted results to produce novel views with consistent geometry and fine-grained details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HairGuard achieves state-of-the-art performance across monocular depth estimation, stereo image/video conversion, and novel view synthesis, with significant improvements in soft boundary regions.",

      "title": "AgentDevel: Reframing Self-Evolving LLM Agents as Release Engineering",
      "abstract": "Recent progress in large language model (LLM) agents has largely focused on embedding self-improvement mechanisms inside the agent or searching over many concurrent variants. While these approaches can raise aggregate scores, they often yield unstable and hard-to-audit improvement trajectories, making it difficult to guarantee non-regression or to reason about failures across versions. We reframe agent improvement as \\textbf{release engineering}: agents are treated as shippable artifacts, and improvement is externalized into a regression-aware release pipeline. We introduce \\textbf{AgentDevel}, a release engineering pipeline that iteratively runs the current agent, produces implementation-blind, symptom-level quality signals from execution traces, synthesizes a single release candidate (RC) via executable diagnosis, and promotes it under flip-centered gating. AgentDevel features three core designs: (i) an implementation-blind LLM critic that characterizes failure appearances without accessing agent internals, (ii) script-based executable diagnosis that aggregates dominant symptom patterns and produces auditable engineering specifications, and (iii) flip-centered gating that prioritizes pass to fail regressions and fail to pass fixes as first-class evidence. Unlike population-based search or in-agent self-refinement, AgentDevel maintains a single canonical version line and emphasizes non-regression as a primary objective. Experiments on execution-heavy benchmarks demonstrate that AgentDevel yields stable improvements with significantly fewer regressions while producing reproducible, auditable artifacts. Overall, AgentDevel provides a practical development discipline for building, debugging, and releasing LLM agents as software development.",

We argue that this is an anthropocentric perspective imposed to a model that might not synthetize visual information as we do.

      "abstract": "Fine-tuning safety-aligned large language models (LLMs) can substantially compromise their safety. Previous approaches require many safety samples or calibration sets, which not only incur significant computational overhead during realignment but also lead to noticeable degradation in model utility. Contrary to this belief, we show that safety alignment can be fully recovered with only a single safety example, without sacrificing utility and at minimal cost . Remarkably, this recovery is effective regardless of the number of harmful examples used in fine-tuning or the size of the underlying model, and convergence is achieved within just a few epochs. Furthermore, we uncover the low-rank structure of the safety gradient, which explains why such efficient correction is possible. We validate our findings across five safety-aligned LLMs and multiple datasets, demonstrating the generality of our approach.",

      "abstract": "Autoformalization, which translates natural language mathematics into formal statements to enable machine reasoning, faces fundamental challenges in the wild due to the multimodal nature of the physical world, where physics requires inferring hidden constraints (e.g., mass or energy) from visual elements. To address this, we propose MMFormalizer, which extends autoformalization beyond text by integrating adaptive grounding with entities from real-world mathematical and physical domains. MMFormalizer recursively constructs formal propositions from perceptually grounded primitives through recursive grounding and axiom composition, with adaptive recursive termination ensuring that every abstraction is supported by visual evidence and anchored in dimensional or axiomatic grounding. We evaluate MMFormalizer on a new benchmark, PhyX-AF, comprising 115 curated samples from MathVerse, PhyX, Synthetic Geometry, and Analytic Geometry, covering diverse multimodal autoformalization tasks. Results show that frontier models such as GPT-5 and Gemini-3-Pro achieve the highest compile and semantic accuracy, with GPT-5 excelling in physical reasoning, while geometry remains the most challenging domain. Overall, MMFormalizer provides a scalable framework for unified multimodal autoformalization, bridging perception and formal reasoning. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first multimodal autoformalization method capable of handling classical mechanics (derived from the Hamiltonian), as well as relativity, quantum mechanics, and thermodynamics.",

      "abstract": "Glad to share our recent exploratory project: 🧪 Title: The Molecular Structure of Thought: Mapping the Topology of Long Chain-of-Thought Reasoning 🌐 arXiv: 2601.06002 ​ 🧐 Why revisit Long CoT? Recent work often focuses on “making CoT longer,” but longer traces are more likely to derail—e.g., drifting off-track, breaking logical continuity, or amplifying hallucinations—especially when attempting to cold-start genuine long-horizon reasoning from a standard instruction-tuned model. ​ A key observation is that many trajectories that merely look like long reasoning (e.g., distilling from randomly sampled ICL demonstrations, or using human-written long step-by-step solutions) are not behaviorally stable, and models frequently fail to learn robustly from them. ​ 😭  Why imitation often fails “Long” human CoT is not necessarily effective: Fine-tuning on human-written long CoT does not reliably reproduce the gains achieved by distilling from a strong reasoning model. Distill from Weak instruct model + random ICL demonstrations largely fails: Using randomly chosen 1-shot ICL examples to “fake” long reasoning for distillation leads to significant degradation, suggesting that superficial formatting is insufficient. ​- Keywords are not the driver: Replacing surface tokens (e.g., “wait”) while preserving the underlying reasoning trajectory and behavioral pattern yields similar performance, indicating that SFT primarily learns structure/behavior rather than prompt-specific keywords. ​ 🔍  Early evidence: Long CoT has stable “structural fingerprints” We observe a stable behavioral transfer graph: across different strong reasoning models and tasks, the induced distributional characteristics appear highly consistent. ​- In semantic space, we see “linking–folding” patterns: deep reasoning tends to form locally dense structures; self-reflection tends to create backward links for validation/correction; and exploration tends to form weaker cross-cluster connections. ​ 💡 Core hypothesis: effective Long CoT as a “molecular structure” High-quality Long CoT is not merely a linear chain; it is stabilized by three interaction types—analogous to chemical bonds—that organize and constrain reasoning trajectories: ​- Deep Reasoning (covalent-bond-like): forms the main reasoning backbone; if it breaks, the solution collapses. ​- Self-Reflection (hydrogen-bond-like): folds later steps back to earlier ones to verify assumptions, detect errors, and correct the path. ​- Self-Exploration (van der Waals-like): weak but important cross-domain probing that broadens coverage and discovers alternative routes. ​ An additional observation is that the Gibbs–Boltzmann energy formulation is closely aligned with the attention formulation; hence, the “energy distributions” of different bonds can be estimated directly from attention, exhibiting a stable ordering reminiscent of real chemical bond energies. ​ 🍎 “Semantic isomers” of Long CoT For the same problem, trajectories can be semantically close yet differ in the distribution and transitions of bonds, yielding distinct “isomers” with dramatically different trainability and downstream performance. ​- Two isomers that appear similar may still be incompatible: mixing them during training can trigger structural conflicts and degrade performance. ​- ICL is not inherently ineffective; it helps when demonstrations are selected such that their structural distribution aligns with the target high-quality isomer. ​ 🔧 Solution: MOLE-SYN We propose MOLE-SYN: first estimate a behavioral transfer graph from a strong reasoning model, then use it to guide a pure instruct LLM to synthesize Long CoT trajectories. ​- Empirically, distilling Qwen-2.5 with MOLE-SYN–generated trajectories can approach the effectiveness of distillation from QwQ. ​- This initialization also exhibits strong RL potential: it yields more stable RL training curves and sustained improvement headroom. Finally, different behaviors have distinct global effects: deep reasoning makes the core logic more compact, self-reflection increases overall “folding” tightness, and self-exploration expands the reachable search space. ​ 👀 A practical implication is that when CoT is heavily summarized or compressed, the “molecular structure” distribution can be destroyed, and distilled models may underperform even the original teacher. ​ If a prior viewpoint treated CoT behaviors as nodes, this work reframes them as edges that link logical states: the training target may not be “longer answers,” but a more stable reasoning skeleton controlled by structured reasoning behaviors. ​",

We compare five popular alignment objectives and various adaptation strategies from source to target, including target-domain supervised fine-tuning and pseudo-labeling, across summarization and question-answering helpfulness tasks. We found: The adaptation strategy is more influential than the alignment objective. We identify that synthetic supervision is a double-edged sword. While pseudo-labeling yields the highest target-domain win rates, it induces severe mode collapse. This diversity tax results in models that are highly reliable but linguistically monotonous, mirroring the latent templates of the teacher model. Our findings suggest a deployment recommendation: use pseudo-labeling for high-stakes and constrained tasks where reliability is paramount, but favor mixed-domain SFT and online RL for applications requiring creative or varied linguistic expression.",

We go beyond fixed compression with agentic self-compression: the agent actively emits a compression rate and is trained with a compression-aware reward to balance task success against token efficiency.

      "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have been widely applied across various domains of finance. Since their training data are largely derived from human-authored corpora, LLMs may inherit a range of human biases. Behavioral biases can lead to instability and uncertainty in decision-making, particularly when processing financial information. However, existing research on LLM bias has mainly focused on direct questioning or simplified, general-purpose settings, with limited consideration of the complex real-world financial environments and high-risk, context-sensitive, multilingual financial misinformation detection tasks (MFMD). In this work, we propose MFMD-Scen, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating behavioral biases of LLMs in MFMD across diverse economic scenarios. In collaboration with financial experts, we construct three types of complex financial scenarios: (i) role- and personality-based, (ii) role- and region-based, and (iii) role-based scenarios incorporating ethnicity and religious beliefs. We further develop a multilingual financial misinformation dataset covering English, Chinese, Greek, and Bengali. By integrating these scenarios with misinformation claims, MFMD-Scen enables a systematic evaluation of 22 mainstream LLMs. Our findings reveal that pronounced behavioral biases persist across both commercial and open-source models.",

Dual Level Credit Assessment This mechanism provides a comprehensive evaluation of query quality through both rule-based and model-based assessments. It allows for fine-grained supervision, helping to identify not just redundancy but also the usefulness of each query in the context of the search process. ii. Process Reward Mechanism The introduction of process rewards as a guiding signal for training search agents is a novel approach. It shifts the focus from solely final outcomes to the quality of intermediate queries, addressing a significant gap in existing methods that often overlook this aspect. iii. Query Refinement Strategy The framework employs a systematic query refinement process that identifies low quality queries and generates improved versions. This iterative refinement enhances the effectiveness of search trajectories, allowing agents to adaptively improve their queries based on feedback. iv. Three Stage Curriculum Learning Framework SmartSearch introduces a structured curriculum learning approach that progresses from imitation to alignment and finally to generalization. This staged learning process enables search agents to internalize query quality improvement progressively, enhancing their overall performance. v. Empirical Validation Across Diverse Benchmarks The paper presents extensive experimental results demonstrating SmartSearch's superior performance across multiple challenging knowledge-intensive tasks and web exploration scenarios. This empirical validation highlights the framework's robustness and effectiveness in real-world applications, showcasing its potential impact on future research in search agents and information retrieval.",

      "abstract": "Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has become a prominent paradigm for scaling Large Language Models (LLMs). Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), such as LoRA, is widely adopted to adapt pretrained MoE LLMs to downstream tasks. However, existing approaches assign identical LoRA ranks to all experts, overlooking the intrinsic functional specialization within MoE LLMs. This uniform allocation leads to resource mismatch, task-relevant experts are under-provisioned while less relevant ones receive redundant parameters. We propose a Dynamic Rank LoRA framework named DR-LoRA, which dynamically grows expert LoRA ranks during fine-tuning based on task-specific demands. DR-LoRA employs an Expert Saliency Scoring mechanism that integrates expert routing frequency and LoRA rank importance to quantify each expert's demand for additional capacity. Experts with higher saliency scores are prioritized for rank expansion, enabling the automatic formation of a heterogeneous rank distribution tailored to the target task. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that DR-LoRA consistently outperforms standard LoRA and static allocation strategies under the same parameter budget, achieving superior task performance with more efficient parameter utilization.",

      "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as intelligent agents that reason, plan, and interact with their environments. To effectively scale to long-horizon scenarios, a key capability for such agents is a memory mechanism that can retain, organize, and retrieve past experiences to support downstream decision-making. However, most existing approaches organize and store memories in a flat manner and rely on simple similarity-based retrieval techniques. Even when structured memory is introduced, existing methods often struggle to explicitly capture the logical relationships among experiences or memory units. Moreover, memory access is largely detached from the constructed structure and still depends on shallow semantic retrieval, preventing agents from reasoning logically over long-horizon dependencies. In this work, we propose CompassMem, an event-centric memory framework inspired by Event Segmentation Theory. CompassMem organizes memory as an Event Graph by incrementally segmenting experiences into events and linking them through explicit logical relations. This graph serves as a logic map, enabling agents to perform structured and goal-directed navigation over memory beyond superficial retrieval, progressively gathering valuable memories to support long-horizon reasoning. Experiments on LoCoMo and NarrativeQA demonstrate that CompassMem consistently improves both retrieval and reasoning performance across multiple backbone models.",

We introduce Multimodal Auto-Completion (MAC), a task that predicts upcoming characters in live chats using partially typed text and visual cues. Unlike traditional text-only auto-completion (TAC), MAC grounds predictions in multimodal context to better capture user intent. To enable this task, we adapt MMDialog and ImageChat to create benchmark datasets. We evaluate leading vision-language models (VLMs) against strong textual baselines, highlighting trade-offs in accuracy and efficiency. We present Router-Suggest, a router framework that dynamically selects between textual models and VLMs based on dialog context, along with a lightweight variant for resource-constrained environments. Router-Suggest achieves a 2.3x to 10x speedup over the best-performing VLM. A user study shows that VLMs significantly excel over textual models on user satisfaction, notably saving user typing effort and improving the quality of completions in multi-turn conversations. These findings underscore the need for multimodal context in auto-completions, leading to smarter, user-aware assistants.",

The authors challenge the assumption that assigning a medical persona consistently improves accuracy or safety, labeling this inconsistency the \"Persona Paradox.\" Key Insights: Non-Monotonic Effects: Assigning a medical persona (like an Emergency Department physician) does not always improve performance. It acts as a behavioral prior that can help in some contexts but hurt in others. The Context Gap: Medical personas improved accuracy and calibration by up to 20% in critical-care tasks (triage) but degraded performance by a similar margin in primary-care settings. Interaction Styles: Adding styles such as \"bold\" or \"cautious\" changes the model’s risk propensity, but these effects vary widely across base models. The Alignment Gap: While \"LLM judges\" preferred medical personas for safety-critical cases, human clinicians were much more skeptical. Human experts showed low confidence in the AI's reasoning quality in 95.9% of cases, despite moderate agreement on safety compliance. Conclusion The study concludes that personas are not \"expertise switches\" but rather priors that introduce context-dependent trade-offs. Relying on personas for clinical safety is risky because they do not provide a universal guarantee of better judgment. Personas should be used with caution in high-stakes medicine, as they can inadvertently trigger biases or performance drops depending on the specific clinical task.",

      "abstract": "As LLM-based agents are increasingly used in long-term interactions, cumulative memory is critical for enabling personalization and maintaining stylistic consistency. However, most existing systems adopt an ``all-or-nothing'' approach to memory usage: incorporating all relevant past information can lead to Memory Anchoring, where the agent is trapped by past interactions, while excluding memory entirely results in under-utilization and the loss of important interaction history. We show that an agent's reliance on memory can be modeled as an explicit and user-controllable dimension. We first introduce a behavioral metric of memory dependence to quantify the influence of past interactions on current outputs. We then propose Steerable Memory Agent, SteeM, a framework that allows users to dynamically regulate memory reliance, ranging from a fresh-start mode that promotes innovation to a high-fidelity mode that closely follows interaction history. Experiments across different scenarios demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms conventional prompting and rigid memory masking strategies, yielding a more nuanced and effective control for personalized human-agent collaboration.",

Training and evaluating agents on complex agentic tasks such as software engineering and computer use requires not only efficient model computation but also sophisticated infrastructure capable of coordinating vast agent-environment interactions. However, no open-source infrastructure can effectively support large-scale training and evaluation on such complex agentic tasks. To address this challenge, we present MegaFlow, a large-scale distributed orchestration system that enables efficient scheduling, resource allocation, and fine-grained task management for agent-environment workloads. MegaFlow abstracts agent training infrastructure into three independent services (Model Service, Agent Service, and Environment Service) that interact through unified interfaces, enabling independent scaling and flexible resource allocation across diverse agent-environment configurations. In our agent training deployments, MegaFlow successfully orchestrates tens of thousands of concurrent agent tasks while maintaining high system stability and achieving efficient resource utilization. By enabling such large-scale agent training, MegaFlow addresses a critical infrastructure gap in the emerging agentic AI landscape.",

      "abstract": "Most current TIR work only focuses on the accuracy of agents in downstream tasks, while lacking calibration of the agents' behavioral patterns in TIR tasks. To address this issue, we first quantitatively analyze several possible erroneous behavioral patterns in current TIR tasks, and classify them into two categories: \"improper tool use\" and \"flawed reasoning logic\". Based on this, we propose ET-Agent, a framework that fully calibrates the behavioral patterns of agents when performing TIR tasks from both data and algorithm levels. On the data side, we propose a self-evolving data flywheel, which enhances the training data by leveraging the agent's own reflective exploration capabilities. On the algorithm side, we propose a behavioral calibration training framework. It performs rejection sampling fine-tuning on the basis of enhanced training data to broaden the agent's exploration of the action space. Subsequently, we implement iterative behavioral calibration reinforcement learning to calibrate the actions of the fine-tuned agent to the optimal behavioral pattern. Our contributions are listed as follows: We provide a comprehensive quantitative analysis of erroneous behavioral patterns in TIR. Inspired by this, we propose ET-Agent, a framework for optimizing TIR's behavioral patterns. We introduce a self-evolving data flywheel, an iterative loop where the model continuously refines its previous trajectories. This mechanism effectively unfolds the model's action space coverage beyond its initial exploration. Based on the flywheel, we present a behavior calibration training framework with two phases, aiming to calibrate the model's exploration in tool-use action space to optimal trajectories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ET-Agent substantially improves behavioral efficiency, reasoning conciseness, and execution success rates while maintaining high accuracy.",

Subsequently, we propose Competitive consensus Chain-of-Thought (CCoT), a multi-path reasoning paradigm that improves the ability of exploring the feasible solution space. To further refine the plan, we integrate a sigmoid-based gating mechanism into the reinforcement learning stage, which dynamically prioritizes soft-constraint satisfaction only after hard constraints are met.

      "abstract": "Current approaches to memory in Large Language Models (LLMs) predominantly rely on static Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which often results in scattered retrieval and fails to capture the structural dependencies required for complex reasoning. For autonomous agents, these passive and flat architectures lack the cognitive organization necessary to model the dynamic and associative nature of long-term interaction. To address this, we propose Structured Episodic Event Memory (SEEM), a hierarchical framework that synergizes a graph memory layer for relational facts with a dynamic episodic memory layer for narrative progression. Grounded in cognitive frame theory, SEEM transforms interaction streams into structured Episodic Event Frames (EEFs) anchored by precise provenance pointers. Furthermore, we introduce an agentic associative fusion and Reverse Provenance Expansion (RPE) mechanism to reconstruct coherent narrative contexts from fragmented evidence. Experimental results on the LoCoMo and LongMemEval benchmarks demonstrate that SEEM significantly outperforms baselines, enabling agents to maintain superior narrative coherence and logical consistency.",

Developers most often describe postponed testing, incomplete adaptation, and limited understanding of AI-generated code, suggesting that AI assistance affects both when and why technical debt emerges.

The lack of structured data on scientific reasoning hinders systematic analysis and development of AI research agents. We introduce Sci-Reasoning, the first dataset capturing the intellectual synthesis behind high-quality AI research. Using community-validated quality signals and an LLM-accelerated, human-verified pipeline, we trace Oral and Spotlight papers across NeurIPS, ICML, and ICLR (2023-2025) to its key predecessors, articulating specific reasoning links in a structured format. Our analysis identifies 15 distinct thinking patterns, with three dominant strategies accounting for 52.7%: Gap-Driven Reframing (24.2%), Cross-Domain Synthesis (18.0%), and Representation Shift (10.5%). The most powerful innovation recipes combine multiple patterns: Gap-Driven Reframing + Representation Shift, Cross-Domain Synthesis + Representation Shift, and Gap-Driven Reframing + Cross-Domain Synthesis. This dataset enables quantitative studies of scientific progress and provides structured reasoning trajectories for training the next generation AI research agents.",

However, how large language models (LLMs) acquire, retain, and forget such concepts during continual pretraining remains poorly understood. In this work, we study how individual concepts are acquired and forgotten, as well as how multiple concepts interact through interference and synergy. We link these behavioral dynamics to LLMs' internal Concept Circuits, computational subgraphs associated with specific concepts, and incorporate Graph Metrics to characterize circuit structure. Our analysis reveals: (1) LLMs concept circuits provide a non-trivial, statistically significant signal of concept learning and forgetting; (2) Concept circuits exhibit a stage-wise temporal pattern during continual pretraining, with an early increase followed by gradual decrease and stabilization; (3) concepts with larger learning gains tend to exhibit greater forgetting under subsequent training; (4) semantically similar concepts induce stronger interference than weakly related ones; (5) conceptual knowledge differs in their transferability, with some significantly facilitating the learning of others. Together, our findings offer a circuit-level view of concept learning dynamics and inform the design of more interpretable and robust concept-aware training strategies for LLMs.",

These two methods have different objectives: SFT minimizes the cross-entropy loss between model outputs and expert responses, while RL maximizes reward signals derived from human preferences or rule-based verifiers. Modern reasoning models have widely adopted the practice of alternating SFT and RL training. However, there is no theoretical account of whether they can be decoupled. We prove that decoupling is impossible in either order: (1) SFT-then-RL coupling: RL increases SFT loss under SFT optimality and (2) RL-then-SFT coupling: SFT lowers the reward achieved by RL. Experiments on Qwen3-0.6B confirm the predicted degradation, verifying that SFT and RL cannot be separated without loss of prior performance in the post-training pipeline.",

Building on this insight, we propose two key contributions: (1) MRN, a normalization method for multi-reward optimization that balances heterogeneous reward signals; and (2) ReFine-RFT, a framework that integrates ensemble rewards with MRN to constrain reasoning length while providing dense, accuracy-oriented feedback.

      "abstract": "This paper introduces FinForge, a novel framework designed to address the scarcity of high-quality, domain-specific datasets for evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) in finance. The authors propose a scalable, semi-synthetic pipeline that combines expert-guided data curation from authoritative sources with controlled question generation and validation using Gemini 2.5 Flash. Key Contributions: FinForge Framework: A hybrid pipeline integrating manual/programmatic corpus construction with rigorous LM-based synthesis. FinForge-5k Dataset: A new snapshot benchmark comprising over 5,000 human-validated Q&A pairs across 11 financial subdomains, derived from a curated corpus of 100,000 verified documents (143M tokens). Benchmarking Results: Evaluation of state-of-the-art open and closed-source models reveals significant variance in financial reasoning capabilities, with leading models achieving approximately 80% accuracy.",

      "title": "Does Inference Scaling Improve Reasoning Faithfulness? A Multi-Model Analysis of Self-Consistency Tradeoffs",
      "abstract": "We ask a question that hasn't been studied before: does inference scaling improve reasoning faithfulness or just accuracy? Self-consistency (majority voting over multiple reasoning paths) reliably boosts LLM accuracy on reasoning tasks. But does getting the right answer more often mean the model is actually reasoning better? We test 4 frontier models (GPT-5.2, Claude Opus 4.5, Gemini-3-flash-preview, and DeepSeek-v3.2) on 100 GSM8K problems and find a surprising tradeoff. Accuracy gains from self-consistency don't necessarily translate to more faithful reasoning. This discovery has important implications for AI safety. We may be building systems that appear smarter without actually reasoning more reliably.",

      "abstract": "Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly deployed in close proximity to humans for applications such as parcel delivery, traffic monitoring, disaster response and infrastructure inspections. Ensuring safe and reliable operation in these human-populated environments demands accurate perception of human poses and actions from an aerial viewpoint. This perspective challenges existing methods with low resolution, steep viewing angles and (self-)occlusion, especially if the application demands realtime feasible models. We train and deploy FlyPose, a lightweight top-down human pose estimation pipeline for aerial imagery. Through multi-dataset training, we achieve an average improvement of 6.8 mAP in person detection across the test-sets of Manipal-UAV, VisDrone, HIT-UAV as well as our custom dataset. For 2D human pose estimation we report an improvement of 16.3 mAP on the challenging UAV-Human dataset. FlyPose runs with an inference latency of ∼20 milliseconds including preprocessing on a Jetson Orin AGX Developer Kit and is deployed onboard a quadrotor UAV during flight experiments. We also publish FlyPose-104, a small but challenging aerial human pose estimation dataset, that includes manual annotations from difficult aerial perspectives: https://github.com/farooqhassaan/FlyPose .",

      "title": "On the Fallacy of Global Token Perplexity in Spoken Language Model Evaluation",
      "abstract": "Generative spoken language models pretrained on large-scale raw audio can continue a speech prompt with appropriate content while preserving attributes like speaker and emotion, serving as foundation models for spoken dialogue. In prior literature, these models are often evaluated using “global token perplexity”, which directly applies the text perplexity formulation to speech tokens. However, this practice overlooks fundamental differences between speech and text modalities, possibly leading to an underestimation of the speech characteristics. In this work, we propose a variety of likelihood- and generative-based evaluation methods that serve in place of naive global token perplexity. We demonstrate that the proposed evaluations more faithfully reflect perceived generation quality, as evidenced by stronger correlations with human-rated mean opinion scores (MOS). When assessed under the new metrics, the relative performance landscape of spoken language models is reshaped, revealing a significantly reduced gap between the best-performing model and the human topline. Together, these results suggest that appropriate evaluation is critical for accurately assessing progress in spoken language modeling.",
