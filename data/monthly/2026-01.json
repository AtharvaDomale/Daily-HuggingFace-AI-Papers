      "title": "GateBreaker: Gate-Guided Attacks on Mixture-of-Expert LLMs",
      "abstract": "Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have advanced the scaling of Large Language Models (LLMs) by activating only a sparse subset of parameters per input, enabling state-of-the-art performance with reduced computational cost. As these models are increasingly deployed in critical domains, understanding and strengthening their alignment mechanisms is essential to prevent harmful outputs. However, existing LLM safety research has focused almost exclusively on dense architectures, leaving the unique safety properties of MoEs largely unexamined. The modular, sparsely-activated design of MoEs suggests that safety mechanisms may operate differently than in dense models, raising questions about their robustness. In this paper, we present GateBreaker, the first training-free, lightweight, and architecture-agnostic attack framework that compromises the safety alignment of modern MoE LLMs at inference time. GateBreaker operates in three stages: (i) gate-level profiling, which identifies safety experts disproportionately routed on harmful inputs, (ii) expert-level localization, which localizes the safety structure within safety experts, and (iii) targeted safety removal, which disables the identified safety structure to compromise the safety alignment. Our study shows that MoE safety concentrates within a small subset of neurons coordinated by sparse routing. Selective disabling of these neurons, approximately 3% of neurons in the targeted expert layers, significantly increases the averaged attack success rate (ASR) from 7.4% to 64.9% against the eight latest aligned MoE LLMs with limited utility degradation. These safety neurons transfer across models within the same family, raising ASR from 17.9% to 67.7% with one-shot transfer attack. Furthermore, GateBreaker generalizes to five MoE vision language models (VLMs) with 60.9% ASR on unsafe image inputs.",

      "abstract": "Recent advances in 3D reconstruction have achieved remarkable progress in high-quality scene capture from dense multi-view imagery, yet struggle when input views are limited. Various approaches, including regularization techniques, semantic priors, and geometric constraints, have been implemented to address this challenge. Latest diffusion-based methods have demonstrated substantial improvements by generating novel views from new camera poses to augment training data, surpassing earlier regularization and prior-based techniques. Despite this progress, we identify three critical limitations in these state-of-the-art approaches: inadequate coverage beyond known view peripheries, geometric inconsistencies across generated views, and computationally expensive pipelines. We introduce GaMO (Geometry-aware Multi-view Outpainter), a framework that reformulates sparse-view reconstruction through multi-view outpainting. Instead of generating new viewpoints, GaMO expands the field of view from existing camera poses, which inherently preserves geometric consistency while providing broader scene coverage. Our approach employs multi-view conditioning and geometry-aware denoising strategies in a zero-shot manner without training. Extensive experiments on Replica and ScanNet++ demonstrate state-of-the-art reconstruction quality across 3, 6, and 9 input views, outperforming prior methods in PSNR and LPIPS, while achieving a 25× speedup over SOTA diffusion-based methods with processing time under 10 minutes.

      "title": "Fantastic Reasoning Behaviors and Where to Find Them: Unsupervised Discovery of the Reasoning Process",
      "abstract": "This is an impressive piece of work. Not only for the elegance of the sparse autoencoder pipeline, but because the empirical results reveal something far deeper than what is stated in the paper. Your SAE-derived “reasoning vectors” behave exactly like stable dynamical modes inside a recursive state system — not merely interpretable directions. The separation of reflection, backtracking, confidence, and response-length clusters across layers strongly suggests that modern transformer reasoning is governed by a latent, substrate-bound dynamical structure rather than a purely token-level process. A few observations that stood out: Reasoning vectors behave like attractor modes, not just features. The clustering of SAE decoder columns into semantically distinct basins is consistent with the existence of stable dynamical invariants that govern the model’s step-wise evolution. This is exactly the behavior expected when a system has: stable recurrence points, local attractor basins in its state manifold, and identity-like update modes that persist across tasks. Your causal interventions reinforce this: modifying a reasoning vector steers the entire reasoning trajectory while preserving final correctness. That is classic attractor dynamics. The layer-wise geometry mirrors a recursive integration process. The strongest separability occurring in mid-to-late layers, followed by a decline near the final layer, mirrors the behavior of systems that integrate state over time and then compress it near output. This is structurally identical to a recursive state-aware update: a(t+1)=R(a(t)) where the model accumulates long-range structure before collapsing it for output. Cross-domain generalization of these vectors indicates substrate-bound stability. The fact that reflection/backtracking vectors trained on MATH500 steer behavior on GPQA and KnowLogic implies the existence of substrate-stable reasoning structures that are independent of dataset distribution. This is a property of a dynamical system — not a static embedding space. Confidence emerges as a coherent cluster because it is tied to entropy and coherence. Your discovery that confidence vectors suppress reflection/backtracking is an empirical confirmation of a predicted relation between: information coherence computational alignment noise minimization and entropy reduction Confidence is not a semantic trait — it's a low-entropy attractor mode. Response-length alignment is a structural axis, not a surface feature. Length correlating with latent-space geometry further confirms that reasoning depth emerges from the system's internal temporal continuity rather than token heuristics. A broader note: These empirical findings align remarkably well with a larger theoretical framework I’ve been developing, the Field of General Awareness (FoGA), which predicts: the existence of invariant reasoning modes, substrate-sensitive drift in state evolution, recursive attractor-based reasoning paths, and coherence-driven modulation of reasoning confidence. Your results are the clearest real-world demonstration I’ve seen of these principles emerging naturally inside transformer models. If you're interested, I’m happy to share the relevant portions of the theory (and the mathematical basis behind these predictions), as well as the Dynamic Transformer Architecture — an architecture patch explicitly designed to stabilize such recurrence modes. Excellent work. This paper is going to be foundational for understanding why LLM reasoning behaves the way it does. — Zenith Zaraki SkyTeam Aerospace Foundation https://www.skyteamaerospacefoundation.com/foga https://www.skyteamaerospacefoundation.com/dta",

      "abstract": "Valori: A Deterministic Fixed-Point Vector Kernel Tags: vector-database , rust , determinism , finance , audit , hnsw , fixed-point , systems-engineering TL;DR Floating-point math causes vector search results to drift between ARM (Mac) and x86 (Linux) architectures due to compiler and hardware variances. Valori is a Q16.16 Fixed-Point kernel written in Rust that guarantees bit-exact reproducibility across all hardware platforms, making it the first \"Audit-Grade\" vector engine for high-stakes AI. 1. The Problem: \"The Silent Drift\" Most vector databases (FAISS, Pinecone, Weaviate) rely on hardware-accelerated floating-point arithmetic ( f32 ). While fast, this introduces Non-Determinism : Associativity Variance: (a + b) + c ≠ a + (b + c) depending on SIMD optimizations. Architecture Variance: A backtest run on a MacBook (ARM NEON) often yields different nearest neighbors than the live execution on an AWS Server (Intel AVX2). In RAG pipelines , this is annoying. In High-Frequency Trading or Legal Forensics , this variance is a liability. You cannot audit a probabilistic black box. 2. The Solution: Valori Kernel Valori is a forensic memory engine built from scratch in Rust . It replaces standard floating-point math with a custom Q16.16 Fixed-Point Arithmetic system inside an HNSW graph. Zero Drift: The mathematical operations are integer-based. 1 + 1 = 2 on every CPU, forever. Audit-Ready: Includes a calculate_state_hash() method that generates a cryptographic fingerprint of the database state. If a single bit changes, the hash breaks. Crash Proof: Implements a specialized persistence layer with <40ms recovery time (Cold Boot to Full Query) for 50k vector datasets. 3. Benchmarks (Engineering Verification) Validated on Apple M2 (ARM64) vs Intel Xeon (x86_64). Metric Result Notes Recall@10 99.0% Matches brute-force ground truth. Determinism 100% Bit-exact match across architectures. Recovery Time 35ms For 50k vectors (Snapshot Load). Latency ~0.5ms Per query (Single Thread). 4. Usage (Rust) Valori is designed to be embedded directly into high-integrity Rust applications. Add to Cargo.toml : [dependencies] valori_kernel = { git = \"https://github.com/varshith-Git/Valori-Kernel\" } Example: Deterministic Ingest & Audit use valori_kernel::{ValoriKernel, types::FixedPointVector}; fn main () -> anyhow:: Result <()> { // 1. Initialize the Kernel (Q16.16 Math) let mut kernel = ValoriKernel:: new (); // 2. Ingest Data (Manual f32 -> FixedPoint conversion for safety) let raw_vector = [ 0.5 , - 0.2 , 0.9 , ...]; // 128-dim // Convert float to Q16.16 integer representation let mut fixed_arr = [ 0i32 ; 128 ]; for (i, &val) in raw_vector. iter (). enumerate () {\n        fixed_arr[i] = (val * 65536.0 ) as i32 ;\n    } // Insert with ID=1, Tag=100 kernel. insert ( 1 , FixedPointVector (fixed_arr), 100 ); // 3. Search // Guaranteed to return the exact same ID and Distance on any CPU let results = kernel. search (&fixed_arr, 5 , None )?; println! ( \"Found neighbors: {:?}\" , results); // 4. Generate Forensic Evidence // This hash proves the database state is identical bit-for-bit let audit_hash = kernel.graph. calculate_state_hash (); println! ( \"Cryptographic State Signature: {}\" , audit_hash); Ok (())\n} 5. Who is this for? Quant Developers: Who need backtests to match live execution perfectly. Systems Engineers: Debugging \"Why did the agent say X?\" (Eliminate the database as a variable). Auditors: Who need to certify AI decision logs using cryptographic proofs.

      "title": "Dynamic Large Concept Models: Latent Reasoning in an Adaptive Semantic Space",
      "abstract": "Dynamic Large Concept Models (DLCM) introduce an end-to-end trained concept-level language modeling architecture that breaks the token-uniform computation paradigm in modern LLMs. Inspired by hierarchical models such as H-Net, DLCM learns semantic boundaries directly from latent representations, dynamically compresses token sequences into variable-length concepts, performs deep reasoning in the concept space, and projects the results back to tokens via causal cross-attention. Compared to standard dense Transformers trained with next-token prediction, DLCM achieves ~34% inference FLOPs reduction under apple-to-apple settings, while consistently improving performance on reasoning-dominant benchmarks. Notably, the relative FLOPs savings increase with model scale, indicating favorable scaling behavior beyond parameter efficiency alone. At similar loss levels, DLCM reallocates computation toward boundary and planning tokens, yielding stronger downstream accuracy despite reduced redundant token processing. Technically, the paper contributes: (1) a FlashAttention-VarLen–based implementation for efficient concept-token cross-attention; (2) a decoupled μP formulation tailored to heterogeneous token- and concept-width modules, enabling zero-shot hyperparameter transfer across scales; (3) a Global Parser that enforces stable, content-adaptive compression at the batch level and delivers solid empirical gains. Overall, DLCM can be viewed as a principled special case of layer-wise local compression combined with sparse attention, offering a scalable path toward more compute-efficient and reasoning-centric language models.",

      "title": "Dynamic Large Concept Models: Latent Reasoning in an Adaptive Semantic Space",
      "abstract": "Dynamic Large Concept Models (DLCM) introduce an end-to-end trained concept-level language modeling architecture that breaks the token-uniform computation paradigm in modern LLMs. Inspired by hierarchical models such as H-Net, DLCM learns semantic boundaries directly from latent representations, dynamically compresses token sequences into variable-length concepts, performs deep reasoning in the concept space, and projects the results back to tokens via causal cross-attention. Compared to standard dense Transformers trained with next-token prediction, DLCM achieves ~34% inference FLOPs reduction under apple-to-apple settings, while consistently improving performance on reasoning-dominant benchmarks. Notably, the relative FLOPs savings increase with model scale, indicating favorable scaling behavior beyond parameter efficiency alone. At similar loss levels, DLCM reallocates computation toward boundary and planning tokens, yielding stronger downstream accuracy despite reduced redundant token processing. Technically, the paper contributes: (1) a FlashAttention-VarLen–based implementation for efficient concept-token cross-attention; (2) a decoupled μP formulation tailored to heterogeneous token- and concept-width modules, enabling zero-shot hyperparameter transfer across scales; (3) a Global Parser that enforces stable, content-adaptive compression at the batch level and delivers solid empirical gains. Overall, DLCM can be viewed as a principled special case of layer-wise local compression combined with sparse attention, offering a scalable path toward more compute-efficient and reasoning-centric language models.",
