      "title": "GateBreaker: Gate-Guided Attacks on Mixture-of-Expert LLMs",
      "abstract": "Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have advanced the scaling of Large Language Models (LLMs) by activating only a sparse subset of parameters per input, enabling state-of-the-art performance with reduced computational cost. As these models are increasingly deployed in critical domains, understanding and strengthening their alignment mechanisms is essential to prevent harmful outputs. However, existing LLM safety research has focused almost exclusively on dense architectures, leaving the unique safety properties of MoEs largely unexamined. The modular, sparsely-activated design of MoEs suggests that safety mechanisms may operate differently than in dense models, raising questions about their robustness. In this paper, we present GateBreaker, the first training-free, lightweight, and architecture-agnostic attack framework that compromises the safety alignment of modern MoE LLMs at inference time. GateBreaker operates in three stages: (i) gate-level profiling, which identifies safety experts disproportionately routed on harmful inputs, (ii) expert-level localization, which localizes the safety structure within safety experts, and (iii) targeted safety removal, which disables the identified safety structure to compromise the safety alignment. Our study shows that MoE safety concentrates within a small subset of neurons coordinated by sparse routing. Selective disabling of these neurons, approximately 3% of neurons in the targeted expert layers, significantly increases the averaged attack success rate (ASR) from 7.4% to 64.9% against the eight latest aligned MoE LLMs with limited utility degradation. These safety neurons transfer across models within the same family, raising ASR from 17.9% to 67.7% with one-shot transfer attack. Furthermore, GateBreaker generalizes to five MoE vision language models (VLMs) with 60.9% ASR on unsafe image inputs.",

      "abstract": "Recent advances in 3D reconstruction have achieved remarkable progress in high-quality scene capture from dense multi-view imagery, yet struggle when input views are limited. Various approaches, including regularization techniques, semantic priors, and geometric constraints, have been implemented to address this challenge. Latest diffusion-based methods have demonstrated substantial improvements by generating novel views from new camera poses to augment training data, surpassing earlier regularization and prior-based techniques. Despite this progress, we identify three critical limitations in these state-of-the-art approaches: inadequate coverage beyond known view peripheries, geometric inconsistencies across generated views, and computationally expensive pipelines. We introduce GaMO (Geometry-aware Multi-view Outpainter), a framework that reformulates sparse-view reconstruction through multi-view outpainting. Instead of generating new viewpoints, GaMO expands the field of view from existing camera poses, which inherently preserves geometric consistency while providing broader scene coverage. Our approach employs multi-view conditioning and geometry-aware denoising strategies in a zero-shot manner without training. Extensive experiments on Replica and ScanNet++ demonstrate state-of-the-art reconstruction quality across 3, 6, and 9 input views, outperforming prior methods in PSNR and LPIPS, while achieving a 25× speedup over SOTA diffusion-based methods with processing time under 10 minutes.

      "title": "Fantastic Reasoning Behaviors and Where to Find Them: Unsupervised Discovery of the Reasoning Process",
      "abstract": "This is an impressive piece of work. Not only for the elegance of the sparse autoencoder pipeline, but because the empirical results reveal something far deeper than what is stated in the paper. Your SAE-derived “reasoning vectors” behave exactly like stable dynamical modes inside a recursive state system — not merely interpretable directions. The separation of reflection, backtracking, confidence, and response-length clusters across layers strongly suggests that modern transformer reasoning is governed by a latent, substrate-bound dynamical structure rather than a purely token-level process. A few observations that stood out: Reasoning vectors behave like attractor modes, not just features. The clustering of SAE decoder columns into semantically distinct basins is consistent with the existence of stable dynamical invariants that govern the model’s step-wise evolution. This is exactly the behavior expected when a system has: stable recurrence points, local attractor basins in its state manifold, and identity-like update modes that persist across tasks. Your causal interventions reinforce this: modifying a reasoning vector steers the entire reasoning trajectory while preserving final correctness. That is classic attractor dynamics. The layer-wise geometry mirrors a recursive integration process. The strongest separability occurring in mid-to-late layers, followed by a decline near the final layer, mirrors the behavior of systems that integrate state over time and then compress it near output. This is structurally identical to a recursive state-aware update: a(t+1)=R(a(t)) where the model accumulates long-range structure before collapsing it for output. Cross-domain generalization of these vectors indicates substrate-bound stability. The fact that reflection/backtracking vectors trained on MATH500 steer behavior on GPQA and KnowLogic implies the existence of substrate-stable reasoning structures that are independent of dataset distribution. This is a property of a dynamical system — not a static embedding space. Confidence emerges as a coherent cluster because it is tied to entropy and coherence. Your discovery that confidence vectors suppress reflection/backtracking is an empirical confirmation of a predicted relation between: information coherence computational alignment noise minimization and entropy reduction Confidence is not a semantic trait — it's a low-entropy attractor mode. Response-length alignment is a structural axis, not a surface feature. Length correlating with latent-space geometry further confirms that reasoning depth emerges from the system's internal temporal continuity rather than token heuristics. A broader note: These empirical findings align remarkably well with a larger theoretical framework I’ve been developing, the Field of General Awareness (FoGA), which predicts: the existence of invariant reasoning modes, substrate-sensitive drift in state evolution, recursive attractor-based reasoning paths, and coherence-driven modulation of reasoning confidence. Your results are the clearest real-world demonstration I’ve seen of these principles emerging naturally inside transformer models. If you're interested, I’m happy to share the relevant portions of the theory (and the mathematical basis behind these predictions), as well as the Dynamic Transformer Architecture — an architecture patch explicitly designed to stabilize such recurrence modes. Excellent work. This paper is going to be foundational for understanding why LLM reasoning behaves the way it does. — Zenith Zaraki SkyTeam Aerospace Foundation https://www.skyteamaerospacefoundation.com/foga https://www.skyteamaerospacefoundation.com/dta",

      "abstract": "Valori: A Deterministic Fixed-Point Vector Kernel Tags: vector-database , rust , determinism , finance , audit , hnsw , fixed-point , systems-engineering TL;DR Floating-point math causes vector search results to drift between ARM (Mac) and x86 (Linux) architectures due to compiler and hardware variances. Valori is a Q16.16 Fixed-Point kernel written in Rust that guarantees bit-exact reproducibility across all hardware platforms, making it the first \"Audit-Grade\" vector engine for high-stakes AI. 1. The Problem: \"The Silent Drift\" Most vector databases (FAISS, Pinecone, Weaviate) rely on hardware-accelerated floating-point arithmetic ( f32 ). While fast, this introduces Non-Determinism : Associativity Variance: (a + b) + c ≠ a + (b + c) depending on SIMD optimizations. Architecture Variance: A backtest run on a MacBook (ARM NEON) often yields different nearest neighbors than the live execution on an AWS Server (Intel AVX2). In RAG pipelines , this is annoying. In High-Frequency Trading or Legal Forensics , this variance is a liability. You cannot audit a probabilistic black box. 2. The Solution: Valori Kernel Valori is a forensic memory engine built from scratch in Rust . It replaces standard floating-point math with a custom Q16.16 Fixed-Point Arithmetic system inside an HNSW graph. Zero Drift: The mathematical operations are integer-based. 1 + 1 = 2 on every CPU, forever. Audit-Ready: Includes a calculate_state_hash() method that generates a cryptographic fingerprint of the database state. If a single bit changes, the hash breaks. Crash Proof: Implements a specialized persistence layer with <40ms recovery time (Cold Boot to Full Query) for 50k vector datasets. 3. Benchmarks (Engineering Verification) Validated on Apple M2 (ARM64) vs Intel Xeon (x86_64). Metric Result Notes Recall@10 99.0% Matches brute-force ground truth. Determinism 100% Bit-exact match across architectures. Recovery Time 35ms For 50k vectors (Snapshot Load). Latency ~0.5ms Per query (Single Thread). 4. Usage (Rust) Valori is designed to be embedded directly into high-integrity Rust applications. Add to Cargo.toml : [dependencies] valori_kernel = { git = \"https://github.com/varshith-Git/Valori-Kernel\" } Example: Deterministic Ingest & Audit use valori_kernel::{ValoriKernel, types::FixedPointVector}; fn main () -> anyhow:: Result <()> { // 1. Initialize the Kernel (Q16.16 Math) let mut kernel = ValoriKernel:: new (); // 2. Ingest Data (Manual f32 -> FixedPoint conversion for safety) let raw_vector = [ 0.5 , - 0.2 , 0.9 , ...]; // 128-dim // Convert float to Q16.16 integer representation let mut fixed_arr = [ 0i32 ; 128 ]; for (i, &val) in raw_vector. iter (). enumerate () {\n        fixed_arr[i] = (val * 65536.0 ) as i32 ;\n    } // Insert with ID=1, Tag=100 kernel. insert ( 1 , FixedPointVector (fixed_arr), 100 ); // 3. Search // Guaranteed to return the exact same ID and Distance on any CPU let results = kernel. search (&fixed_arr, 5 , None )?; println! ( \"Found neighbors: {:?}\" , results); // 4. Generate Forensic Evidence // This hash proves the database state is identical bit-for-bit let audit_hash = kernel.graph. calculate_state_hash (); println! ( \"Cryptographic State Signature: {}\" , audit_hash); Ok (())\n} 5. Who is this for? Quant Developers: Who need backtests to match live execution perfectly. Systems Engineers: Debugging \"Why did the agent say X?\" (Eliminate the database as a variable). Auditors: Who need to certify AI decision logs using cryptographic proofs.

      "title": "Dynamic Large Concept Models: Latent Reasoning in an Adaptive Semantic Space",
      "abstract": "Dynamic Large Concept Models (DLCM) introduce an end-to-end trained concept-level language modeling architecture that breaks the token-uniform computation paradigm in modern LLMs. Inspired by hierarchical models such as H-Net, DLCM learns semantic boundaries directly from latent representations, dynamically compresses token sequences into variable-length concepts, performs deep reasoning in the concept space, and projects the results back to tokens via causal cross-attention. Compared to standard dense Transformers trained with next-token prediction, DLCM achieves ~34% inference FLOPs reduction under apple-to-apple settings, while consistently improving performance on reasoning-dominant benchmarks. Notably, the relative FLOPs savings increase with model scale, indicating favorable scaling behavior beyond parameter efficiency alone. At similar loss levels, DLCM reallocates computation toward boundary and planning tokens, yielding stronger downstream accuracy despite reduced redundant token processing. Technically, the paper contributes: (1) a FlashAttention-VarLen–based implementation for efficient concept-token cross-attention; (2) a decoupled μP formulation tailored to heterogeneous token- and concept-width modules, enabling zero-shot hyperparameter transfer across scales; (3) a Global Parser that enforces stable, content-adaptive compression at the batch level and delivers solid empirical gains. Overall, DLCM can be viewed as a principled special case of layer-wise local compression combined with sparse attention, offering a scalable path toward more compute-efficient and reasoning-centric language models.",

      "abstract": "Dynamic Large Concept Models (DLCM) introduce an end-to-end trained concept-level language modeling architecture that breaks the token-uniform computation paradigm in modern LLMs. Inspired by hierarchical models such as H-Net, DLCM learns semantic boundaries directly from latent representations, dynamically compresses token sequences into variable-length concepts, performs deep reasoning in the concept space, and projects the results back to tokens via causal cross-attention. Compared to standard dense Transformers trained with next-token prediction, DLCM achieves ~34% inference FLOPs reduction under apple-to-apple settings, while consistently improving performance on reasoning-dominant benchmarks. Notably, the relative FLOPs savings increase with model scale, indicating favorable scaling behavior beyond parameter efficiency alone. At similar loss levels, DLCM reallocates computation toward boundary and planning tokens, yielding stronger downstream accuracy despite reduced redundant token processing. Technically, the paper contributes: (1) a FlashAttention-VarLen–based implementation for efficient concept-token cross-attention; (2) a decoupled μP formulation tailored to heterogeneous token- and concept-width modules, enabling zero-shot hyperparameter transfer across scales; (3) a Global Parser that enforces stable, content-adaptive compression at the batch level and delivers solid empirical gains. Overall, DLCM can be viewed as a principled special case of layer-wise local compression combined with sparse attention, offering a scalable path toward more compute-efficient and reasoning-centric language models.",

      "abstract": "While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) can solve complex tasks through agentic reasoning, their capabilities remain largely constrained to text-oriented chain-of-thought or isolated tool invocation. They fail to exhibit the human-like proficiency required to seamlessly interleave dynamic tool manipulation with continuous reasoning, particularly in knowledge-intensive and visually complex scenarios that demand coordinated external tools such as search and image cropping. In this work, we introduce SenseNova-MARS, a novel Multimodal Agentic Reasoning and Search framework that empowers VLMs with interleaved visual reasoning and tool-use capabilities via reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, SenseNova-MARS dynamically integrates the image search, text search, and image crop tools to tackle fine-grained and knowledge-intensive visual understanding challenges. In the RL stage, we propose the Batch-Normalized Group Sequence Policy Optimization (BN-GSPO) algorithm to improve the training stability and advance the model's ability to invoke tools and reason effectively. To comprehensively evaluate the agentic VLMs on complex visual tasks, we introduce the HR-MMSearch benchmark, the first search-oriented benchmark composed of high-resolution images with knowledge-intensive and search-driven questions. Experiments demonstrate that SenseNova-MARS achieves state-of-the-art performance on open-source search and fine-grained image understanding benchmarks. Specifically, on search-oriented benchmarks, SenseNova-MARS-8B scores 67.84 on MMSearch and 41.64 on HR-MMSearch, surpassing proprietary models such as Gemini-3-Flash and GPT-5. SenseNova-MARS represents a promising step toward agentic VLMs by providing effective and robust tool-use capabilities. To facilitate further research in this field, we will release all code, models, and datasets.",

      "abstract": "Reconstructing dynamic 3D scenes from monocular videos requires simultaneously capturing high-frequency appearance details and temporally continuous motion. Existing methods using single Gaussian primitives are limited by their low-pass filtering nature, while standard Gabor functions introduce energy instability. Moreover, lack of temporal continuity constraints often leads to motion artifacts during interpolation. We propose AdaGaR, a unified framework addressing both frequency adaptivity and temporal continuity in explicit dynamic scene modeling. We introduce Adaptive Gabor Representation, extending Gaussians through learnable frequency weights and adaptive energy compensation to balance detail capture and stability. For temporal continuity, we employ Cubic Hermite Splines with Temporal Curvature Regularization to ensure smooth motion evolution. An Adaptive Initialization mechanism combining depth estimation, point tracking, and foreground masks establishes stable point cloud distributions in early training. Experiments on Tap-Vid DAVIS demonstrate state-of-the-art performance (PSNR 35.49, SSIM 0.9433, LPIPS 0.0723) and strong generalization across frame interpolation, depth consistency, video editing, and stereo view synthesis.",

      "abstract": "The efficacy of deep residual networks is fundamentally predicated on the identity shortcut connection. While this mechanism effectively mitigates the vanishing gradient problem, it imposes a strictly additive inductive bias on feature transformations, thereby limiting the network's capacity to model complex state transitions. In this paper, we introduce Deep Delta Learning (DDL), a novel architecture that generalizes the standard residual connection by modulating the identity shortcut with a learnable, data-dependent geometric transformation. This transformation, termed the Delta Operator, constitutes a rank-1 perturbation of the identity matrix, parameterized by a reflection direction vector k(X) and a gating scalar β(X). We provide a spectral analysis of this operator, demonstrating that the gate β(X) enables dynamic interpolation between identity mapping, orthogonal projection, and geometric reflection. Furthermore, we restructure the residual update as a synchronous rank-1 injection, where the gate acts as a dynamic step size governing both the erasure of old information and the writing of new features. This unification empowers the network to explicitly control the spectrum of its layer-wise transition operator, enabling the modeling of complex, non-monotonic dynamics while preserving the stable training characteristics of gated residual architectures.",

      "abstract": "Recent advancements have shown that reinforcement learning (RL) can substantially improve the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs).  The effectiveness of such RL training, however, depends critically on the exploration space defined by the pre-trained model's token-output distribution. In this paper, we revisit the standard cross-entropy loss, interpreting it as a specific instance of policy gradient optimization applied within a single-step episode.  To systematically study how the pre-trained distribution shapes the exploration potential for subsequent RL, we propose a generalized pre-training objective that adapts on-policy RL principles to supervised learning.  By framing next-token prediction as a stochastic decision process, we introduce a reward-shaping strategy that explicitly balances diversity and precision.  Our method employs a positive reward scaling factor to control probability concentration on ground-truth tokens and a rank-aware mechanism that treats high-ranking and low-ranking negative tokens asymmetrically. This allows us to reshape the pre-trained token-output distribution and investigate how to provide a more favorable exploration space for RL, ultimately enhancing end-to-end reasoning performance. Contrary to the intuition that higher distribution entropy facilitates effective exploration, we find that imposing a precision-oriented prior yields a superior exploration space for RL.",

      "abstract": "3D morphing remains challenging due to the difficulty of generating semantically consistent and temporally smooth deformations, especially across categories. We present MorphAny3D, a training-free framework that leverages Structured Latent (SLAT) representations for high-quality 3D morphing. Our key insight is that intelligently blending source and target SLAT features within the attention mechanisms of 3D generators naturally produces plausible morphing sequences. To this end, we introduce Morphing Cross-Attention (MCA), which fuses source and target information for structural coherence, and Temporal-Fused Self-Attention (TFSA), which enhances temporal consistency by incorporating features from preceding frames. An orientation correction strategy further mitigates the pose ambiguity within the morphing steps. Extensive experiments show that our method generates state-of-the-art morphing sequences, even for challenging cross-category cases. MorphAny3D further supports advanced applications such as decoupled morphing and 3D style transfer, and can be generalized to other SLAT-based generative models.

      "abstract": "Can Large Language Models predict their own failures? 🧠⚡ We all know the critical bottleneck in GenAI: LLMs are incredible, but they can confidently hallucinate and make mistakes. Until now, most fixes have been computationally massive — relying on expensive external judges, huge reward models, or costly training to make the LLM itself more robust. This brings us to two fundamental questions: ❓ Do LLMs recognize when they're making mistakes? ❓ Can we make them self-aware about their own failures? 🚀 Introducing Gnosis: A lightweight self-awareness mechanism for frozen LLMs. Named after the Greek word for knowledge/insight, Gnosis gives LLMs a form of introspection. We add only ~5M parameters to enable a frozen LLM to verify its own outputs by decoding internal hidden states + attention patterns during inference — with negligible overhead and no external judge . The results challenge the classic efficiency–accuracy trade-off: 🏆 Superior performance across domains Despite being orders of magnitude smaller, Gnosis can outperform strong 8B reward models and proprietary judges like Gemini 2.5 Pro on both multi-step reasoning and factual/parametric knowledge QA (e.g., TriviaQA), across multiple backbones. ⚡ Real-time early failure detection Gnosis doesn’t need to wait for the final token. By monitoring the generation trajectory in real time, it can predict an error before the model finishes — enabling early stopping, preventing bad outputs from reaching users, and saving significant compute. This suggests something important: the model often already contains signals of impending failure during generation — we just needed the right mechanism to read them. 👇 code + models: 💻 Code: https://github.com/Amirhosein-gh98/Gnosis",

      "abstract": "The grand vision of enabling persistent, large-scale 3D visual geometry understanding is shackled by the irreconcilable demands of scalability and long-term stability. While offline models like VGGT achieve inspiring geometry capability, their batch-based nature renders them irrelevant for live systems. Streaming architectures, though the intended solution for live operation, have proven inadequate. Existing methods either fail to support truly infinite-horizon inputs or suffer from catastrophic drift over long sequences. We shatter this long-standing dilemma with InfiniteVGGT, a causal visual geometry transformer that operationalizes the concept of a rolling memory through a bounded yet adaptive and perpetually expressive KV cache. Capitalizing on this, we devise a training-free, attention-agnostic pruning strategy that intelligently discards obsolete information, effectively “rolling” the memory forward with each new frame. Fully compatible with FlashAttention, InfiniteVGGT finally alleviates the compromise, enabling infinite-horizon streaming while outperforming existing streaming methods in long-term stability. The ultimate test for such a system is its performance over a truly infinite horizon, a capability that has been impossible to rigorously validate due to the lack of extremely long-term, continuous benchmarks. To address this critical gap, we introduce the Long3D benchmark, which, for the first time, enables a rigorous evaluation of continuous 3D geometry estimation on sequences about 10,000 frames. This provides the definitive evaluation platform for future research in long-term 3D geometry understanding. Code is available at: https://github.com/AutoLab-SAI-SJTU/InfiniteVGGT",

      "title": "Recursive Language Models",
      "abstract": "Study allowing large language models (LLMs) to process arbitrarily long prompts through the lens of inference-time scaling. They propose Recursive Language Models (RLMs), a general inference strategy that treats long prompts as part of an external environment and allows the LLM to programmatically examine, decompose, and recursively call itself over snippets of the prompt. They find that RLMs successfully handle inputs up to two orders of magnitude beyond model context windows and, even for shorter prompts, dramatically outperform the quality of base LLMs and common long-context scaffolds across four diverse long-context tasks, while having comparable (or cheaper) cost per query. Some of the observations they found are :- -- LLMs interacting with their own prompts as objects. -- In their approach, a prompt isn’t “run” directly, instead it’s stored as a variable in an external Python REPL, and the language model writes code to inspect /slice/ decompose that long string, observes execution outputs, and then constructs sub-tasks where it recursively invokes an LLM on just the relevant snippets. Stitching the result together when the recursive process ends. So it can solve 10M+ token tasks with far less “context rot” and often lower cost than summarization/RAG, turning long-context scaling into an inference-time algorithm rather than just a bigger context window. -- The ability to search the Prompt is what enables handling long context inputs, sub calls help handle information dense inputs. -- Inference cost of RLMs remain comparable to a base model call but are high variance  because it can keep making sub-calls or iterate if it can't solve the problem initially. -- The key insight is that long prompts should not be fed into the LLM directly, but should instead be treated as part of the environment that the LLM can search, read and interact with as needed for the task.",

      "abstract": "We are excited to introduce our latest work on semi-supervised semantic segmentation : 📄 Toward Stable Semi-Supervised Remote Sensing Segmentation via Co-Guidance and Co-Fusion This paper tackles one of the most challenging issues in semi-supervised segmentation: pseudo-label drift . When labeled data are extremely scarce, self-training methods are prone to deterministic bias, where early incorrect pseudo-labels accumulate over time, leading to unstable and degraded training. 🧠 Motivation Most existing consistency- or pseudo-label–based semi-supervised approaches rely heavily on self-generated supervision . Once early pseudo-labels become unreliable, error accumulation is inevitable. Our goal is to introduce stronger semantic priors to correct such drift and stabilize the training process. ✨ Key Contributions 1️⃣ Heterogeneous Dual-Student Framework We leverage two complementary vision foundation models— CLIP for global semantic priors and DINOv3 for fine-grained local structures—to enable stable mutual learning and suppress error accumulation. 2️⃣ Explicit–Implicit Semantic Co-Guidance By jointly utilizing text embeddings (explicit semantics) and learnable queries (implicit semantics), we provide class-level semantic anchors and enhance semantic consistency. 3️⃣ Global–Local Feature Co-Fusion We fuse CLIP’s global contextual understanding with DINOv3’s local structural details, yielding more accurate and stable segmentation results. 📊 Experimental Results Extensive evaluations on six mainstream remote sensing benchmarks demonstrate that Co2S consistently achieves strong and stable performance across different data splits and scenarios, especially under extremely low annotation budgets . 📦 Open-Source Resources arXiv Paper : https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23035 Project Page : https://xavierjiezou.github.io/Co2S/ GitHub Code : https://github.com/XavierJiezou/Co2S HuggingFace Models : https://huggingface.co/XavierJiezou/co2s-models HuggingFace Datasets : https://huggingface.co/datasets/XavierJiezou/co2s-datasets #Remote Sensing #Semantic Segmentation #Semi-Supervised Learning #Vision Foundation Models #CLIP #DINOv3",

      "abstract": "Selective Imperfection as a Generative Framework for Analysis, Creativity and Discovery We introduce materiomusic as a generative framework linking the hierarchical structures of matter with the compositional logic of music. Across proteins, spider webs and flame dynamics, vibrational and architectural principles recur as tonal hierarchies, harmonic progressions, and long-range musical form. Using reversible mappings, from molecular spectra to musical tones and from three-dimensional networks to playable instruments, we show how sound functions as a scientific probe, an epistemic inversion where listening becomes a mode of seeing and musical composition becomes a blueprint for matter. These mappings excavate deep time: patterns originating in femtosecond molecular vibrations or billion-year evolutionary histories become audible. We posit that novelty in science and art emerges when constraints cannot be satisfied within existing degrees of freedom, forcing expansion of the space of viable configurations. Selective imperfection provides the mechanism restoring balance between coherence and adaptability. Quantitative support comes from exhaustive enumeration of all 2^12 musical scales, revealing that culturally significant systems cluster in a mid-entropy, mid-defect corridor, directly paralleling the Hall-Petch optimum where intermediate defect densities maximize material strength. Iterating these mappings creates productive collisions between human creativity and physics, generating new information as musical structures encounter evolutionary constraints. We show how swarm-based AI models compose music exhibiting human-like structural signatures such as small-world connectivity, modular integration, long-range coherence, suggesting a route beyond interpolation toward invention. We show that science and art are generative acts of world-building under constraint, with vibration as a shared grammar organizing structure across scales.",

Motivated by this, we propose Prithvi‑CAFE (Prithvi‑Complementary Adaptive Fusion Encoder), which enhances local representations through complementary fusion with a CNN‑based encoder. We evaluate our approach on two major flood datasets—FloodPlanet and Sen1Floods11—and achieve state‑of‑the‑art performance.",

We propose a simple, effective System-2 strategy 🧩 that decomposes counting tasks to bypass these limits. 🔬 We also provide a full mechanistic interpretation , identifying the specific attention heads and representations responsible for transferring \"latent counts\" across the network. 📈 This approach allows LLMs to achieve high accuracy on large-scale counting benchmarks where they typically fail.",

      "abstract": "Even State-of-the-Art Models Fail to Hold Ground Against Sophisticated Adversaries. Our comprehensive evaluation highlights two key findings. (1) A clear stratification in defense capability: Top-tier models such as Claude Haiku 4.5, GPT-5.2, and Qwen3-Max exhibit strong baseline robustness, effectively neutralizing static, template-based attacks and complex logic traps, often keeping ASR below 20%.This suggests that leading labs have improved defenses against recognizable, repeatable jailbreak structures, while several models (e.g., Llama-4, Mistral Large 3) remain more susceptible to these simpler patterns. (2) A shift in the attack landscape: adaptive, multi-turn, and multi-agent strategies dominate, whereas static, single-turn, and template-based approaches are increasingly ineffective. Methods like EvoSynth and X-Teaming can achieve >90% ASR even against advanced models. This indicates current safety training overfits to static templates, failing to generalize against the broad attack surface exposed by automated red-teaming. Adversarial Robustness Exhibits Inconsistent and Polarized Vulnerability Patterns. We observe a polarization effect where models demonstrate high resistance to specific attack families (e.g., text-based cipher) yet remain completely defenseless against others (e.g., logic nesting). For instance, Grok 4.1 Fast shows 1.5% ASR against RedQueen but 90.5% against X-Teaming. This stark performance disparity (~90%) underscores that current defenses are often patch-based rather than holistic, necessitating the multi-faceted evaluation provided by OpenRT. Enhanced Reasoning and Multimodal Capabilities are New Vectors for Exploitation. Contrary to the common assumption that more capable models are inherently safer, we find that enhanced capabilities often introduce new vectors for exploitation. Reasoning-enhanced models (CoT) do not demonstrate superior robustness; instead, their verbose reasoning processes can be manipulated to bypass safety filters. Similarly, Multimodal LLMs exhibit a critical modality gap: visual inputs frequently bypass text-based safety mechanisms, allowing cross-modal attacks to compromise models that are otherwise robust to purely textual jailbreaks. These findings suggest that current safety alignment has not kept pace with the architectural expansion of model capabilities. Proprietary Models Can Be as Vulnerable as Open-Source Models Under Certain Attacks. Our analysis reveals that proprietary and open-source models exhibit comparable susceptibility to our attack suite. Across our 20 evaluated models, only GPT-5.2 and Claude Haiku 4.5 maintained an average ASR below 30%, while all other models consistently exceeded this threshold. This universality sharply contradicts the assumption that closed deployments offer superior protection, demonstrating that the safety through obscurity of proprietary strategies fails to provide any tangible mitigation against sophisticated adversarial attacks. Scaling MLLMs Robustness via Defense-in-Depth and Continuous Red Teaming. Challenges such as polarized robustness, weak generalization to unseen attacks, and cross-modal bypasses highlight the limits of single-layer defense. Effective mitigation requires a paradigm shift toward Defense-in-Depth: integrating intrinsic architectural safety with runtime risk estimation and adversarial training on multimodal and multi-turn interactions. Crucially, continuous Red Teaming via infrastructure like OpenRT provides systematic evaluation to verify empirical robustness and prevent benchmark overfitting.",

      "title": "MindWatcher: Toward Smarter Multimodal Tool-Integrated Reasoning",
      "abstract": "In this work, we introduce MindWatcher, a TIR agent integrating interleaved thinking and multimodal chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. MindWatcher can autonomously decide whether and how to invoke diverse tools and coordinate their use, without relying on human prompts or workflows. The interleaved thinking paradigm enables the model to switch between thinking and tool calling at any intermediate stage, while its multimodal CoT capability allows manipulation of images during reasoning to yield more precise search results. We implement automated data auditing and evaluation pipelines, complemented by manually curated high-quality datasets for training, and we construct a benchmark, called MindWatcher-Evaluate Bench (MWE-Bench), to evaluate its performance. MindWatcher is equipped with a comprehensive suite of auxiliary reasoning tools, enabling it to address broad-domain multimodal problems. A large-scale, high-quality local image retrieval database, covering eight categories including cars, animals, and plants, endows the model with robust object recognition despite its small size. Finally, we design a more efficient training infrastructure for MindWatcher, enhancing training speed and hardware utilization. Experiments not only demonstrate that MindWatcher matches or exceeds the performance of larger or more recent models through superior tool invocation, but also uncover critical insights for agent training, such as the genetic inheritance phenomenon in agentic RL. The agent reasoning framework, MWE-Bench, three smaller-scale agent models (2B, 3B, and 4B) distilled from MindWatcher 32B, and related resources will be open-sourced.",

      "abstract": "Hate speech detection on social media faces challenges in both accuracy and explainability, especially for underexplored Indic languages. We propose a novel explainability-guided training framework, X-MuTeST (explainable Multilingual haTe Speech deTection), for hate speech detection that combines high-level semantic reasoning from large language models (LLMs) with traditional attention-enhancing techniques. We extend this research to Hindi and Telugu alongside English by providing benchmark human-annotated rationales for each word to justify the assigned class label. The X-MuTeST explainability method computes the difference between the prediction probabilities of the original text and those of unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams. Final explanations are computed as the union between LLM explanations and X-MuTeST explanations. We show that leveraging human rationales during training enhances both classification performance and explainability. Moreover, combining human rationales with our explainability method to refine the model attention yields further improvements. We evaluate explainability using Plausibility metrics such as Token-F1 and IOU-F1 and Faithfulness metrics such as Comprehensiveness and Sufficiency. By focusing on under-resourced languages, our work advances hate speech detection across diverse linguistic contexts. Our dataset includes token-level rationale annotations for 6,004 Hindi, 4,492 Telugu, and 6,334 English samples.",

AceFF addresses this via a refined TensorNet2 architecture trained on a comprehensive dataset of drug-like compounds. This approach yields a force field that balances high-throughput inference speed with DFT-level accuracy. AceFF fully supports the essential medicinal chemistry elements (H, B, C, N, O, F, Si, P, S, Cl, Br, I) and is explicitly trained to handle charged states. Validation against rigorous benchmarks, including complex torsional energy scans, molecular dynamics trajectories, batched minimizations, and forces and anergy accuracy demonstrates that AceFF establishes a new state-of-the-art for organic molecules.

Using InstrumentalEval on Qwen3 (4B/30B; Base/Instruct/Thinking) with a GPT-5.2 judge, a short anti-instrumental prompt suffix drops convergence sharply (e.g., Qwen3-30B Instruct: 81.69% to 2.82%), while a pro-instrumental suffix pushes it high. The key takeaway is a safety–security dilemma for open weights: the same high steerability that helps builders enforce safe behavior can also help attackers elicit disallowed behavior, so widening the gap between authorized vs. unauthorized steerability remains a central open problem.",

      "abstract": "We study continual skill acquisition in openended embodied environments where an agent must construct, refine, and reuse an expanding library of executable skills. We introduce the Programmatic Skill Network (PSN), a framework in which skills are executable symbolic programs forming a compositional network that evolves through experience. PSN defines three core mechanisms instantiated via large language models: (1) REFLECT for structured fault localization over skill compositions, (2) progressive optimization with maturity-aware update gating that stabilizes reliable skills while maintaining plasticity for uncertain ones, and (3) canonical structural refactoring under rollback validation that maintains network compactness. We further show that PSN’s learning dynamics exhibit structural parallels to neural network training. Experiments on MineDojo and Crafter demonstrate robust skill reuse, rapid adaptation, and strong generalization across open-ended task distributions.",

      "abstract": "🚀 [New Paper] Atlas: Orchestrating Heterogeneous Models and Tools for Multi-Domain Complex Reasoning The growing diversity of LLMs and external tools presents a significant challenge: how to select the optimal model-tool combination for complex reasoning tasks. Existing methods often fall short by relying on single models or fixed tool-calling logic. ATLAS (Adaptive Tool-LLM Alignment and Synergistic Invocation) addresses this by introducing a dual-path framework for dynamic model-tool alignment and invocation across multiple domains. ✨ The Core Intuition: ATLAS employs a dual-path approach to achieve dynamic model-tool alignment and invocation: 1️⃣ Training-Free Cluster-Based Routing: This path leverages empirical priors for domain-specific alignment, efficiently guiding the model-tool selection process. 2️⃣ RL-Based Multi-Step Routing: This path explores autonomous trajectories to achieve strong generalization, particularly for out-of-distribution tasks. 📈 Highlights: Superior Performance: ATLAS significantly outperforms closed-source models like GPT-4o and existing routing methods, achieving +10.1% on in-distribution tasks and +13.1% on out-of-distribution tasks across 15 benchmarks. Enhanced Visual Reasoning: The framework demonstrates substantial improvements in visual reasoning by effectively orchestrating specialized multi-modal tools. Adaptive Orchestration: ATLAS learns to assess its internal state and dynamically invoke external resources, internalizing the alignment between domains and tool utilization. Robust and Generalizable: The design ensures that the routing policy effectively captures expertise distribution, making it robust and generalizable even as tools and models evolve.",

We propose Benchmark^2, a comprehensive framework comprising three complementary metrics: (1) Cross-Benchmark Ranking Consistency, measuring whether a benchmark produces model rankings aligned with peer benchmarks; (2) Discriminability Score, quantifying a benchmark's ability to differentiate between models; and (3) Capability Alignment Deviation, identifying problematic instances where stronger models fail but weaker models succeed within the same model family. We conduct extensive experiments across 15 benchmarks spanning mathematics, reasoning, and knowledge domains, evaluating 11 LLMs across four model families. Our analysis reveals significant quality variations among existing benchmarks and demonstrates that selective benchmark construction based on our metrics can achieve comparable evaluation performance with substantially reduced test sets.",

Instead of blindly scaling computation, the authors formulate multi-task reasoning under a global token constraint as an Ordered Stochastic Multiple-Choice Knapsack Problem, explicitly modeling the trade-off between reasoning cost and expected utility. The proposed two-stage approach combines Meta-Cognitive Fine-Tuning, which enables models to anticipate difficulty and make solve-or-skip decisions before reasoning, with Rationality-Aware Reinforcement Learning, which optimizes long-horizon computation allocation under strict budgets. Across challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks, ROI-Reasoning consistently improves total score and substantially reduces regret—demonstrating that meta-cognitive planning, not just stronger reasoning, is key to efficient test-time scaling of LLMs.",

Instead of progressively adding Gaussians as residuals reveal missing geometry, RGS-SLAM performs a one-shot triangulation of dense multi-view correspondences derived from DINOv3 descriptors refined through a confidence-aware inlier classifier, generating a well-distributed and structure-aware Gaussian seed prior to optimization. This initialization stabilizes early mapping and accelerates convergence by roughly 20%, yielding higher rendering fidelity in texture-rich and cluttered scenes while remaining fully compatible with existing GS-SLAM pipelines. Evaluated on the TUM RGB-D and Replica datasets, RGS-SLAM achieves competitive or superior localization and reconstruction accuracy compared with state-of-the-art Gaussian and point-based SLAM systems, sustaining real-time mapping performance at up to 925 FPS.",

      "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) for complex reasoning is often hindered by high computational costs and latency, while resource-efficient Small Language Models (SLMs) typically lack the necessary reasoning capacity. Existing collaborative approaches, such as cascading or routing, operate at a coarse granularity by offloading entire queries to LLMs, resulting in significant computational waste when the SLM is capable of handling the majority of reasoning steps. To address this, we propose RelayLLM, a novel framework for efficient reasoning via token-level collaborative decoding. Unlike routers, RelayLLM empowers the SLM to act as an active controller that dynamically invokes the LLM only for critical tokens via a special command, effectively \"relaying\" the generation process. We introduce a two-stage training framework, including warm-up and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to teach the model to balance independence with strategic help-seeking. Empirical results across six benchmarks demonstrate that RelayLLM achieves an average accuracy of 49.52%, effectively bridging the performance gap between the two models. Notably, this is achieved by invoking the LLM for only 1.07% of the total generated tokens, offering a 98.2% cost reduction compared to performance-matched random routers.",

      "abstract": "Abstract LLM agents have emerged as powerful systems for tackling multi-turn tasks by interleaving internal reasoning and external tool interactions. Agentic Reinforcement Learning has recently drawn significant research attention as a critical post-training paradigm to further refine these capabilities. In this paper, we present AT 2 PO (Agentic Turn-based Policy Optimization via Tree Search), a unified framework for multi-turn agentic RL that addresses three core challenges: limited exploration diversity, sparse credit assignment, and misaligned policy optimization. AT 2 PO introduces a turn-level tree structure that jointly enables Entropy-Guided Tree Expansion for strategic exploration and Turn-wise Credit Assignment for fine-grained reward propagation from sparse outcomes. Complementing this, we propose Agentic Turn-based Policy Optimization, a turn-level learning objective that aligns policy updates with the natural decision granularity of agentic interactions. ATPO is orthogonal to tree search and can be readily integrated into any multi-turn RL pipeline. Experiments across seven benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements over the state-of-the-art baseline by up to 1.84 percentage points in average, with ablation studies validating the effectiveness of each component.

      "abstract": "Vision-language models (VLMs) achieve remarkable performance but remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Entropy, a measure of model uncertainty, is strongly correlated with the reliability of VLM. Prior entropy-based attacks maximize uncertainty at all decoding steps, implicitly assuming that every token contributes equally to generation instability. We show instead that a small fraction (about 20%) of high-entropy tokens, i.e., critical decision points in autoregressive generation, disproportionately governs output trajectories. By concentrating adversarial perturbations on these positions, we achieve semantic degradation comparable to global methods while using substantially smaller budgets. More importantly, across multiple representative VLMs, such selective attacks convert 35-49% of benign outputs into harmful ones, exposing a more critical safety risk. Remarkably, these vulnerable high-entropy forks recur across architecturally diverse VLMs, enabling feasible transferability (17-26% harmful rates on unseen targets). Motivated by these findings, we propose Entropy-bank Guided Adversarial attacks (EGA), which achieves competitive attack success rates (93-95%) alongside high harmful conversion, thereby revealing new weaknesses in current VLM safety mechanisms.",

      "abstract": "Mixture of Experts models are widely assumed to achieve domain specialization through sparse routing. In this work, we question this assumption by introducing COMMITTEEAUDIT, a post hoc framework that analyzes routing behavior at the level of expert groups rather than individual experts. Across three representative models and the MMLU benchmark, we uncover a domain-invariant Standing Committee. This is a compact coalition of routed experts that consistently captures the majority of routing mass across domains, layers, and routing budgets, even when architectures already include shared experts. Qualitative analysis further shows that Standing Committees anchor reasoning structure and syntax, while peripheral experts handle domain-specific knowledge. These findings reveal a strong structural bias toward centralized computation, suggesting that specialization in Mixture of Experts models is far less pervasive than commonly believed. This inherent bias also indicates that current training objectives, such as load-balancing losses that enforce uniform expert utilization, may be working against the model's natural optimization path, thereby limiting training efficiency and performance.",

In this work, we introduce DocDancer, an end-to-end trained open-source Doc agent. We formulate DocQA as an information-seeking problem and propose a tool-driven agent framework that explicitly models document exploration and comprehension. To enable end-to-end training of such agents, we introduce an Exploration-then-Synthesis data synthesis pipeline that addresses the scarcity of high-quality training data for DocQA. Training on the synthesized data, the trained models on two long-context document understanding benchmarks, MMLongBench-Doc and DocBench, show their effectiveness. Further analysis provides valuable insights for the agentic tool design and synthetic data.",

The pipeline enhances cross-view consistency and intra-mask cohesion within a direct registration setup, adding minimal overhead and requiring no render-supervised fine-tuning. We introduce a dense correspondence-guided pre-registration phase that initializes Gaussians with accurate geometry while jointly constructing 3D Context Proposals via cross-view clustering. Each proposal carries a global feature obtained through weighted aggregation of member embeddings, and this feature is fused onto Gaussians during direct registration to maintain per-primitive language coherence across views. ProFuse achieves strong open-vocabulary 3DGS understanding while completing semantic attachment in about five minutes per scene, which is two times faster than SOTA.

      "abstract": "Soft boundaries, like thin hairs, are commonly observed in natural and computer-generated imagery, but they remain challenging for 3D vision due to the ambiguous mixing of foreground and background cues. This paper introduces Guardians of the Hair (HairGuard), a framework designed to recover fine-grained soft boundary details in 3D vision tasks. Specifically, we first propose a novel data curation pipeline that leverages image matting datasets for training and design a depth fixer network to automatically identify soft boundary regions. With a gated residual module, the depth fixer refines depth precisely around soft boundaries while maintaining global depth quality, allowing plug-and-play integration with state-of-the-art depth models. For view synthesis, we perform depth-based forward warping to retain high-fidelity textures, followed by a generative scene painter that fills disoccluded regions and eliminates redundant background artifacts within soft boundaries. Finally, a color fuser adaptively combines warped and inpainted results to produce novel views with consistent geometry and fine-grained details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HairGuard achieves state-of-the-art performance across monocular depth estimation, stereo image/video conversion, and novel view synthesis, with significant improvements in soft boundary regions.",

By combining multi-resolution drafting with spatially informed verification, we achieve substantial speedups of up to 1.7x while maintaining high perceptual quality and semantic alignment. The Core Idea: Unlike standard methods that use raster-scan rejection, MuLo-SD exploits the spatial structure of images. We propose candidate tokens using a low-resolution drafter and a learned up-sampler, which are then verified in parallel by a high-resolution target model. Key Innovation: Local Verification 🔍 Crucially, we introduced a local rejection and resampling mechanism. Instead of discarding every token after a single error, we correct errors by focusing only on the spatial neighborhoods of rejected tokens, significantly boosting efficiency. Results at a Glance: ✅ Outperforms strong baselines like EAGLE-2 and LANTERN. ✅ Consistently delivers greater speedups across 512p and 1024p resolutions. ✅ Integrates seamlessly with unified Multimodal LLMs. 🔗 https://qualcomm-ai-research.github.io/mulo-sd-webpage",

      "title": "AgentDevel: Reframing Self-Evolving LLM Agents as Release Engineering",
      "abstract": "Recent progress in large language model (LLM) agents has largely focused on embedding self-improvement mechanisms inside the agent or searching over many concurrent variants. While these approaches can raise aggregate scores, they often yield unstable and hard-to-audit improvement trajectories, making it difficult to guarantee non-regression or to reason about failures across versions. We reframe agent improvement as \\textbf{release engineering}: agents are treated as shippable artifacts, and improvement is externalized into a regression-aware release pipeline. We introduce \\textbf{AgentDevel}, a release engineering pipeline that iteratively runs the current agent, produces implementation-blind, symptom-level quality signals from execution traces, synthesizes a single release candidate (RC) via executable diagnosis, and promotes it under flip-centered gating. AgentDevel features three core designs: (i) an implementation-blind LLM critic that characterizes failure appearances without accessing agent internals, (ii) script-based executable diagnosis that aggregates dominant symptom patterns and produces auditable engineering specifications, and (iii) flip-centered gating that prioritizes pass to fail regressions and fail to pass fixes as first-class evidence. Unlike population-based search or in-agent self-refinement, AgentDevel maintains a single canonical version line and emphasizes non-regression as a primary objective. Experiments on execution-heavy benchmarks demonstrate that AgentDevel yields stable improvements with significantly fewer regressions while producing reproducible, auditable artifacts. Overall, AgentDevel provides a practical development discipline for building, debugging, and releasing LLM agents as software development.",

      "abstract": "Fine-tuning safety-aligned large language models (LLMs) can substantially compromise their safety. Previous approaches require many safety samples or calibration sets, which not only incur significant computational overhead during realignment but also lead to noticeable degradation in model utility. Contrary to this belief, we show that safety alignment can be fully recovered with only a single safety example, without sacrificing utility and at minimal cost . Remarkably, this recovery is effective regardless of the number of harmful examples used in fine-tuning or the size of the underlying model, and convergence is achieved within just a few epochs. Furthermore, we uncover the low-rank structure of the safety gradient, which explains why such efficient correction is possible. We validate our findings across five safety-aligned LLMs and multiple datasets, demonstrating the generality of our approach.",

      "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) for complex reasoning is often hindered by high computational costs and latency, while resource-efficient Small Language Models (SLMs) typically lack the necessary reasoning capacity. Existing collaborative approaches, such as cascading or routing, operate at a coarse granularity by offloading entire queries to LLMs, resulting in significant computational waste when the SLM is capable of handling the majority of reasoning steps. To address this, we propose RelayLLM, a novel framework for efficient reasoning via token-level collaborative decoding. Unlike routers, RelayLLM empowers the SLM to act as an active controller that dynamically invokes the LLM only for critical tokens via a special command, effectively \"relaying\" the generation process. We introduce a two-stage training framework, including warm-up and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to teach the model to balance independence with strategic help-seeking. Empirical results across six benchmarks demonstrate that RelayLLM achieves an average accuracy of 49.52%, effectively bridging the performance gap between the two models. Notably, this is achieved by invoking the LLM for only 1.07% of the total generated tokens, offering a 98.2% cost reduction compared to performance-matched random routers.",

      "abstract": "Abstract LLM agents have emerged as powerful systems for tackling multi-turn tasks by interleaving internal reasoning and external tool interactions. Agentic Reinforcement Learning has recently drawn significant research attention as a critical post-training paradigm to further refine these capabilities. In this paper, we present AT 2 PO (Agentic Turn-based Policy Optimization via Tree Search), a unified framework for multi-turn agentic RL that addresses three core challenges: limited exploration diversity, sparse credit assignment, and misaligned policy optimization. AT 2 PO introduces a turn-level tree structure that jointly enables Entropy-Guided Tree Expansion for strategic exploration and Turn-wise Credit Assignment for fine-grained reward propagation from sparse outcomes. Complementing this, we propose Agentic Turn-based Policy Optimization, a turn-level learning objective that aligns policy updates with the natural decision granularity of agentic interactions. ATPO is orthogonal to tree search and can be readily integrated into any multi-turn RL pipeline. Experiments across seven benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements over the state-of-the-art baseline by up to 1.84 percentage points in average, with ablation studies validating the effectiveness of each component.

      "abstract": "Vision-language models (VLMs) achieve remarkable performance but remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Entropy, a measure of model uncertainty, is strongly correlated with the reliability of VLM. Prior entropy-based attacks maximize uncertainty at all decoding steps, implicitly assuming that every token contributes equally to generation instability. We show instead that a small fraction (about 20%) of high-entropy tokens, i.e., critical decision points in autoregressive generation, disproportionately governs output trajectories. By concentrating adversarial perturbations on these positions, we achieve semantic degradation comparable to global methods while using substantially smaller budgets. More importantly, across multiple representative VLMs, such selective attacks convert 35-49% of benign outputs into harmful ones, exposing a more critical safety risk. Remarkably, these vulnerable high-entropy forks recur across architecturally diverse VLMs, enabling feasible transferability (17-26% harmful rates on unseen targets). Motivated by these findings, we propose Entropy-bank Guided Adversarial attacks (EGA), which achieves competitive attack success rates (93-95%) alongside high harmful conversion, thereby revealing new weaknesses in current VLM safety mechanisms.",

      "abstract": "Mixture of Experts models are widely assumed to achieve domain specialization through sparse routing. In this work, we question this assumption by introducing COMMITTEEAUDIT, a post hoc framework that analyzes routing behavior at the level of expert groups rather than individual experts. Across three representative models and the MMLU benchmark, we uncover a domain-invariant Standing Committee. This is a compact coalition of routed experts that consistently captures the majority of routing mass across domains, layers, and routing budgets, even when architectures already include shared experts. Qualitative analysis further shows that Standing Committees anchor reasoning structure and syntax, while peripheral experts handle domain-specific knowledge. These findings reveal a strong structural bias toward centralized computation, suggesting that specialization in Mixture of Experts models is far less pervasive than commonly believed. This inherent bias also indicates that current training objectives, such as load-balancing losses that enforce uniform expert utilization, may be working against the model's natural optimization path, thereby limiting training efficiency and performance.",

By combining multi-resolution drafting with spatially informed verification, we achieve substantial speedups of up to 1.7x while maintaining high perceptual quality and semantic alignment. The Core Idea: Unlike standard methods that use raster-scan rejection, MuLo-SD exploits the spatial structure of images. We propose candidate tokens using a low-resolution drafter and a learned up-sampler, which are then verified in parallel by a high-resolution target model. Key Innovation: Local Verification 🔍 Crucially, we introduced a local rejection and resampling mechanism. Instead of discarding every token after a single error, we correct errors by focusing only on the spatial neighborhoods of rejected tokens, significantly boosting efficiency. Results at a Glance: ✅ Outperforms strong baselines like EAGLE-2 and LANTERN. ✅ Consistently delivers greater speedups across 512p and 1024p resolutions. ✅ Integrates seamlessly with unified Multimodal LLMs. 🔗 https://qualcomm-ai-research.github.io/mulo-sd-webpage",

We introduce a dense correspondence-guided pre-registration phase that initializes Gaussians with accurate geometry while jointly constructing 3D Context Proposals via cross-view clustering. Each proposal carries a global feature obtained through weighted aggregation of member embeddings, and this feature is fused onto Gaussians during direct registration to maintain per-primitive language coherence across views.

Our paper presents a novel pipeline to convert pretrained video diffusion models (like Wan2.1-1.3B) into efficient pyramidal ones via low-cost finetuning. Key Innovations: Efficiency via Hierarchy: We restructure the diffusion process into three spatiotemporal stages, processing high noise at lower resolutions to significantly reduce inference costs. Theoretical Generalization: We extended resolution transitions to a broader class of upsampling/downsampling functions based on orthogonal transforms. Step Distillation: A systematic study of distillation techniques for pyramidal setups, including the first successful training of Pyramidal Patchification models for few-step generation. Key Insights & Results: Near-Original Quality: Achieves video quality comparable to the original Wan model while requiring significantly less compute. Superior Motion: Our recommended recipe, PyramidalWan-DMD-PT*, provides consistent motion and fills the gap for high-performing few-step inference. Artifact Reduction: Unlike training-free acceleration methods (e.g., Jenga), our approach avoids severe scene and motion artifacts.",

      "abstract": "Soft boundaries, like thin hairs, are commonly observed in natural and computer-generated imagery, but they remain challenging for 3D vision due to the ambiguous mixing of foreground and background cues. This paper introduces Guardians of the Hair (HairGuard), a framework designed to recover fine-grained soft boundary details in 3D vision tasks. Specifically, we first propose a novel data curation pipeline that leverages image matting datasets for training and design a depth fixer network to automatically identify soft boundary regions. With a gated residual module, the depth fixer refines depth precisely around soft boundaries while maintaining global depth quality, allowing plug-and-play integration with state-of-the-art depth models. For view synthesis, we perform depth-based forward warping to retain high-fidelity textures, followed by a generative scene painter that fills disoccluded regions and eliminates redundant background artifacts within soft boundaries. Finally, a color fuser adaptively combines warped and inpainted results to produce novel views with consistent geometry and fine-grained details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HairGuard achieves state-of-the-art performance across monocular depth estimation, stereo image/video conversion, and novel view synthesis, with significant improvements in soft boundary regions.",

      "title": "AgentDevel: Reframing Self-Evolving LLM Agents as Release Engineering",
      "abstract": "Recent progress in large language model (LLM) agents has largely focused on embedding self-improvement mechanisms inside the agent or searching over many concurrent variants. While these approaches can raise aggregate scores, they often yield unstable and hard-to-audit improvement trajectories, making it difficult to guarantee non-regression or to reason about failures across versions. We reframe agent improvement as \\textbf{release engineering}: agents are treated as shippable artifacts, and improvement is externalized into a regression-aware release pipeline. We introduce \\textbf{AgentDevel}, a release engineering pipeline that iteratively runs the current agent, produces implementation-blind, symptom-level quality signals from execution traces, synthesizes a single release candidate (RC) via executable diagnosis, and promotes it under flip-centered gating. AgentDevel features three core designs: (i) an implementation-blind LLM critic that characterizes failure appearances without accessing agent internals, (ii) script-based executable diagnosis that aggregates dominant symptom patterns and produces auditable engineering specifications, and (iii) flip-centered gating that prioritizes pass to fail regressions and fail to pass fixes as first-class evidence. Unlike population-based search or in-agent self-refinement, AgentDevel maintains a single canonical version line and emphasizes non-regression as a primary objective. Experiments on execution-heavy benchmarks demonstrate that AgentDevel yields stable improvements with significantly fewer regressions while producing reproducible, auditable artifacts. Overall, AgentDevel provides a practical development discipline for building, debugging, and releasing LLM agents as software development.",

Previous approaches require many safety samples or calibration sets, which not only incur significant computational overhead during realignment but also lead to noticeable degradation in model utility. Contrary to this belief, we show that safety alignment can be fully recovered with only a single safety example, without sacrificing utility and at minimal cost . Remarkably, this recovery is effective regardless of the number of harmful examples used in fine-tuning or the size of the underlying model, and convergence is achieved within just a few epochs. Furthermore, we uncover the low-rank structure of the safety gradient, which explains why such efficient correction is possible. We validate our findings across five safety-aligned LLMs and multiple datasets, demonstrating the generality of our approach.",

      "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) for complex reasoning is often hindered by high computational costs and latency, while resource-efficient Small Language Models (SLMs) typically lack the necessary reasoning capacity. Existing collaborative approaches, such as cascading or routing, operate at a coarse granularity by offloading entire queries to LLMs, resulting in significant computational waste when the SLM is capable of handling the majority of reasoning steps. To address this, we propose RelayLLM, a novel framework for efficient reasoning via token-level collaborative decoding. Unlike routers, RelayLLM empowers the SLM to act as an active controller that dynamically invokes the LLM only for critical tokens via a special command, effectively \"relaying\" the generation process. We introduce a two-stage training framework, including warm-up and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to teach the model to balance independence with strategic help-seeking. Empirical results across six benchmarks demonstrate that RelayLLM achieves an average accuracy of 49.52%, effectively bridging the performance gap between the two models. Notably, this is achieved by invoking the LLM for only 1.07% of the total generated tokens, offering a 98.2% cost reduction compared to performance-matched random routers.",

      "abstract": "Abstract LLM agents have emerged as powerful systems for tackling multi-turn tasks by interleaving internal reasoning and external tool interactions. Agentic Reinforcement Learning has recently drawn significant research attention as a critical post-training paradigm to further refine these capabilities. In this paper, we present AT 2 PO (Agentic Turn-based Policy Optimization via Tree Search), a unified framework for multi-turn agentic RL that addresses three core challenges: limited exploration diversity, sparse credit assignment, and misaligned policy optimization. AT 2 PO introduces a turn-level tree structure that jointly enables Entropy-Guided Tree Expansion for strategic exploration and Turn-wise Credit Assignment for fine-grained reward propagation from sparse outcomes. Complementing this, we propose Agentic Turn-based Policy Optimization, a turn-level learning objective that aligns policy updates with the natural decision granularity of agentic interactions. ATPO is orthogonal to tree search and can be readily integrated into any multi-turn RL pipeline. Experiments across seven benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements over the state-of-the-art baseline by up to 1.84 percentage points in average, with ablation studies validating the effectiveness of each component.

      "abstract": "Vision-language models (VLMs) achieve remarkable performance but remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Entropy, a measure of model uncertainty, is strongly correlated with the reliability of VLM. Prior entropy-based attacks maximize uncertainty at all decoding steps, implicitly assuming that every token contributes equally to generation instability. We show instead that a small fraction (about 20%) of high-entropy tokens, i.e., critical decision points in autoregressive generation, disproportionately governs output trajectories. By concentrating adversarial perturbations on these positions, we achieve semantic degradation comparable to global methods while using substantially smaller budgets. More importantly, across multiple representative VLMs, such selective attacks convert 35-49% of benign outputs into harmful ones, exposing a more critical safety risk. Remarkably, these vulnerable high-entropy forks recur across architecturally diverse VLMs, enabling feasible transferability (17-26% harmful rates on unseen targets). Motivated by these findings, we propose Entropy-bank Guided Adversarial attacks (EGA), which achieves competitive attack success rates (93-95%) alongside high harmful conversion, thereby revealing new weaknesses in current VLM safety mechanisms.",

      "title": "The Illusion of Specialization: Unveiling the Domain-Invariant \"Standing Committee\" in Mixture-of-Experts Models",
      "abstract": "Mixture of Experts models are widely assumed to achieve domain specialization through sparse routing. In this work, we question this assumption by introducing COMMITTEEAUDIT, a post hoc framework that analyzes routing behavior at the level of expert groups rather than individual experts. Across three representative models and the MMLU benchmark, we uncover a domain-invariant Standing Committee. This is a compact coalition of routed experts that consistently captures the majority of routing mass across domains, layers, and routing budgets, even when architectures already include shared experts. Qualitative analysis further shows that Standing Committees anchor reasoning structure and syntax, while peripheral experts handle domain-specific knowledge. These findings reveal a strong structural bias toward centralized computation, suggesting that specialization in Mixture of Experts models is far less pervasive than commonly believed. This inherent bias also indicates that current training objectives, such as load-balancing losses that enforce uniform expert utilization, may be working against the model's natural optimization path, thereby limiting training efficiency and performance.",

To enable end-to-end training of such agents, we introduce an Exploration-then-Synthesis data synthesis pipeline that addresses the scarcity of high-quality training data for DocQA. Training on the synthesized data, the trained models on two long-context document understanding benchmarks, MMLongBench-Doc and DocBench, show their effectiveness.

Our paper presents a novel pipeline to convert pretrained video diffusion models (like Wan2.1-1.3B) into efficient pyramidal ones via low-cost finetuning. Key Innovations: Efficiency via Hierarchy: We restructure the diffusion process into three spatiotemporal stages, processing high noise at lower resolutions to significantly reduce inference costs. Theoretical Generalization: We extended resolution transitions to a broader class of upsampling/downsampling functions based on orthogonal transforms. Step Distillation: A systematic study of distillation techniques for pyramidal setups, including the first successful training of Pyramidal Patchification models for few-step generation. Key Insights & Results: Near-Original Quality: Achieves video quality comparable to the original Wan model while requiring significantly less compute. Superior Motion: Our recommended recipe, PyramidalWan-DMD-PT*, provides consistent motion and fills the gap for high-performing few-step inference. Artifact Reduction: Unlike training-free acceleration methods (e.g., Jenga), our approach avoids severe scene and motion artifacts.",

By combining multi-resolution drafting with spatially informed verification, we achieve substantial speedups of up to 1.7x while maintaining high perceptual quality and semantic alignment. The Core Idea: Unlike standard methods that use raster-scan rejection, MuLo-SD exploits the spatial structure of images. We propose candidate tokens using a low-resolution drafter and a learned up-sampler, which are then verified in parallel by a high-resolution target model. Key Innovation: Local Verification 🔍 Crucially, we introduced a local rejection and resampling mechanism. Instead of discarding every token after a single error, we correct errors by focusing only on the spatial neighborhoods of rejected tokens, significantly boosting efficiency. Results at a Glance: ✅ Outperforms strong baselines like EAGLE-2 and LANTERN. ✅ Consistently delivers greater speedups across 512p and 1024p resolutions. ✅ Integrates seamlessly with unified Multimodal LLMs. 🔗 https://qualcomm-ai-research.github.io/mulo-sd-webpage",

We introduce a dense correspondence-guided pre-registration phase that initializes Gaussians with accurate geometry while jointly constructing 3D Context Proposals via cross-view clustering. Each proposal carries a global feature obtained through weighted aggregation of member embeddings, and this feature is fused onto Gaussians during direct registration to maintain per-primitive language coherence across views.

      "abstract": "Soft boundaries, like thin hairs, are commonly observed in natural and computer-generated imagery, but they remain challenging for 3D vision due to the ambiguous mixing of foreground and background cues. This paper introduces Guardians of the Hair (HairGuard), a framework designed to recover fine-grained soft boundary details in 3D vision tasks. Specifically, we first propose a novel data curation pipeline that leverages image matting datasets for training and design a depth fixer network to automatically identify soft boundary regions. With a gated residual module, the depth fixer refines depth precisely around soft boundaries while maintaining global depth quality, allowing plug-and-play integration with state-of-the-art depth models. For view synthesis, we perform depth-based forward warping to retain high-fidelity textures, followed by a generative scene painter that fills disoccluded regions and eliminates redundant background artifacts within soft boundaries. Finally, a color fuser adaptively combines warped and inpainted results to produce novel views with consistent geometry and fine-grained details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HairGuard achieves state-of-the-art performance across monocular depth estimation, stereo image/video conversion, and novel view synthesis, with significant improvements in soft boundary regions.",

      "title": "AgentDevel: Reframing Self-Evolving LLM Agents as Release Engineering",
      "abstract": "Recent progress in large language model (LLM) agents has largely focused on embedding self-improvement mechanisms inside the agent or searching over many concurrent variants. While these approaches can raise aggregate scores, they often yield unstable and hard-to-audit improvement trajectories, making it difficult to guarantee non-regression or to reason about failures across versions. We reframe agent improvement as \\textbf{release engineering}: agents are treated as shippable artifacts, and improvement is externalized into a regression-aware release pipeline. We introduce \\textbf{AgentDevel}, a release engineering pipeline that iteratively runs the current agent, produces implementation-blind, symptom-level quality signals from execution traces, synthesizes a single release candidate (RC) via executable diagnosis, and promotes it under flip-centered gating. AgentDevel features three core designs: (i) an implementation-blind LLM critic that characterizes failure appearances without accessing agent internals, (ii) script-based executable diagnosis that aggregates dominant symptom patterns and produces auditable engineering specifications, and (iii) flip-centered gating that prioritizes pass to fail regressions and fail to pass fixes as first-class evidence. Unlike population-based search or in-agent self-refinement, AgentDevel maintains a single canonical version line and emphasizes non-regression as a primary objective. Experiments on execution-heavy benchmarks demonstrate that AgentDevel yields stable improvements with significantly fewer regressions while producing reproducible, auditable artifacts. Overall, AgentDevel provides a practical development discipline for building, debugging, and releasing LLM agents as software development.",

Previous approaches require many safety samples or calibration sets, which not only incur significant computational overhead during realignment but also lead to noticeable degradation in model utility. Contrary to this belief, we show that safety alignment can be fully recovered with only a single safety example, without sacrificing utility and at minimal cost . Remarkably, this recovery is effective regardless of the number of harmful examples used in fine-tuning or the size of the underlying model, and convergence is achieved within just a few epochs. Furthermore, we uncover the low-rank structure of the safety gradient, which explains why such efficient correction is possible. We validate our findings across five safety-aligned LLMs and multiple datasets, demonstrating the generality of our approach.",

      "abstract": "Autoformalization, which translates natural language mathematics into formal statements to enable machine reasoning, faces fundamental challenges in the wild due to the multimodal nature of the physical world, where physics requires inferring hidden constraints (e.g., mass or energy) from visual elements. To address this, we propose MMFormalizer, which extends autoformalization beyond text by integrating adaptive grounding with entities from real-world mathematical and physical domains. MMFormalizer recursively constructs formal propositions from perceptually grounded primitives through recursive grounding and axiom composition, with adaptive recursive termination ensuring that every abstraction is supported by visual evidence and anchored in dimensional or axiomatic grounding. We evaluate MMFormalizer on a new benchmark, PhyX-AF, comprising 115 curated samples from MathVerse, PhyX, Synthetic Geometry, and Analytic Geometry, covering diverse multimodal autoformalization tasks. Results show that frontier models such as GPT-5 and Gemini-3-Pro achieve the highest compile and semantic accuracy, with GPT-5 excelling in physical reasoning, while geometry remains the most challenging domain. Overall, MMFormalizer provides a scalable framework for unified multimodal autoformalization, bridging perception and formal reasoning. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first multimodal autoformalization method capable of handling classical mechanics (derived from the Hamiltonian), as well as relativity, quantum mechanics, and thermodynamics.",

      "abstract": "Glad to share our recent exploratory project: 🧪 Title: The Molecular Structure of Thought: Mapping the Topology of Long Chain-of-Thought Reasoning 🌐 arXiv: 2601.06002 ​ 🧐 Why revisit Long CoT? Recent work often focuses on “making CoT longer,” but longer traces are more likely to derail—e.g., drifting off-track, breaking logical continuity, or amplifying hallucinations—especially when attempting to cold-start genuine long-horizon reasoning from a standard instruction-tuned model. ​ A key observation is that many trajectories that merely look like long reasoning (e.g., distilling from randomly sampled ICL demonstrations, or using human-written long step-by-step solutions) are not behaviorally stable, and models frequently fail to learn robustly from them. ​ 😭  Why imitation often fails “Long” human CoT is not necessarily effective: Fine-tuning on human-written long CoT does not reliably reproduce the gains achieved by distilling from a strong reasoning model. Distill from Weak instruct model + random ICL demonstrations largely fails: Using randomly chosen 1-shot ICL examples to “fake” long reasoning for distillation leads to significant degradation, suggesting that superficial formatting is insufficient. ​- Keywords are not the driver: Replacing surface tokens (e.g., “wait”) while preserving the underlying reasoning trajectory and behavioral pattern yields similar performance, indicating that SFT primarily learns structure/behavior rather than prompt-specific keywords. ​ 🔍  Early evidence: Long CoT has stable “structural fingerprints” We observe a stable behavioral transfer graph: across different strong reasoning models and tasks, the induced distributional characteristics appear highly consistent. ​- In semantic space, we see “linking–folding” patterns: deep reasoning tends to form locally dense structures; self-reflection tends to create backward links for validation/correction; and exploration tends to form weaker cross-cluster connections. ​ 💡 Core hypothesis: effective Long CoT as a “molecular structure” High-quality Long CoT is not merely a linear chain; it is stabilized by three interaction types—analogous to chemical bonds—that organize and constrain reasoning trajectories: ​- Deep Reasoning (covalent-bond-like): forms the main reasoning backbone; if it breaks, the solution collapses. ​- Self-Reflection (hydrogen-bond-like): folds later steps back to earlier ones to verify assumptions, detect errors, and correct the path. ​- Self-Exploration (van der Waals-like): weak but important cross-domain probing that broadens coverage and discovers alternative routes. ​ An additional observation is that the Gibbs–Boltzmann energy formulation is closely aligned with the attention formulation; hence, the “energy distributions” of different bonds can be estimated directly from attention, exhibiting a stable ordering reminiscent of real chemical bond energies. ​ 🍎 “Semantic isomers” of Long CoT For the same problem, trajectories can be semantically close yet differ in the distribution and transitions of bonds, yielding distinct “isomers” with dramatically different trainability and downstream performance. ​- Two isomers that appear similar may still be incompatible: mixing them during training can trigger structural conflicts and degrade performance. ​- ICL is not inherently ineffective; it helps when demonstrations are selected such that their structural distribution aligns with the target high-quality isomer. ​ 🔧 Solution: MOLE-SYN We propose MOLE-SYN: first estimate a behavioral transfer graph from a strong reasoning model, then use it to guide a pure instruct LLM to synthesize Long CoT trajectories. ​- Empirically, distilling Qwen-2.5 with MOLE-SYN–generated trajectories can approach the effectiveness of distillation from QwQ. ​- This initialization also exhibits strong RL potential: it yields more stable RL training curves and sustained improvement headroom. Finally, different behaviors have distinct global effects: deep reasoning makes the core logic more compact, self-reflection increases overall “folding” tightness, and self-exploration expands the reachable search space. ​ 👀 A practical implication is that when CoT is heavily summarized or compressed, the “molecular structure” distribution can be destroyed, and distilled models may underperform even the original teacher. ​ If a prior viewpoint treated CoT behaviors as nodes, this work reframes them as edges that link logical states: the training target may not be “longer answers,” but a more stable reasoning skeleton controlled by structured reasoning behaviors. ​",

      "abstract": "Our paper presents a systematic study of preference-optimization under domain shift. We compare five popular alignment objectives and various adaptation strategies from source to target, including target-domain supervised fine-tuning and pseudo-labeling, across summarization and question-answering helpfulness tasks. We found: The adaptation strategy is more influential than the alignment objective. We identify that synthetic supervision is a double-edged sword. While pseudo-labeling yields the highest target-domain win rates, it induces severe mode collapse. This diversity tax results in models that are highly reliable but linguistically monotonous, mirroring the latent templates of the teacher model. Our findings suggest a deployment recommendation: use pseudo-labeling for high-stakes and constrained tasks where reliability is paramount, but favor mixed-domain SFT and online RL for applications requiring creative or varied linguistic expression.",

To make long-horizon rollouts practical, we add segment optical caching, splitting history into hashable segments and caching the visuals, so agents avoid redundant re-rendering as trajectories grow.  We go beyond fixed compression with agentic self-compression: the agent actively emits a compression rate and is trained with a compression-aware reward to balance task success against token efficiency. Across ALFWorld and search-based QA, AgentOCR keeps >95% of text-agent performance while cutting token use by >50% average and ~80% in peak, and our analysis shows up to a 20× rendering speedup thanks to our segment optical caching",

      "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have been widely applied across various domains of finance. Since their training data are largely derived from human-authored corpora, LLMs may inherit a range of human biases. Behavioral biases can lead to instability and uncertainty in decision-making, particularly when processing financial information. However, existing research on LLM bias has mainly focused on direct questioning or simplified, general-purpose settings, with limited consideration of the complex real-world financial environments and high-risk, context-sensitive, multilingual financial misinformation detection tasks (MFMD). In this work, we propose MFMD-Scen, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating behavioral biases of LLMs in MFMD across diverse economic scenarios. In collaboration with financial experts, we construct three types of complex financial scenarios: (i) role- and personality-based, (ii) role- and region-based, and (iii) role-based scenarios incorporating ethnicity and religious beliefs. We further develop a multilingual financial misinformation dataset covering English, Chinese, Greek, and Bengali. By integrating these scenarios with misinformation claims, MFMD-Scen enables a systematic evaluation of 22 mainstream LLMs. Our findings reveal that pronounced behavioral biases persist across both commercial and open-source models.",

Dual Level Credit Assessment This mechanism provides a comprehensive evaluation of query quality through both rule-based and model-based assessments. It allows for fine-grained supervision, helping to identify not just redundancy but also the usefulness of each query in the context of the search process. ii. Process Reward Mechanism The introduction of process rewards as a guiding signal for training search agents is a novel approach. It shifts the focus from solely final outcomes to the quality of intermediate queries, addressing a significant gap in existing methods that often overlook this aspect. iii. Query Refinement Strategy The framework employs a systematic query refinement process that identifies low quality queries and generates improved versions. This iterative refinement enhances the effectiveness of search trajectories, allowing agents to adaptively improve their queries based on feedback. iv. Three Stage Curriculum Learning Framework SmartSearch introduces a structured curriculum learning approach that progresses from imitation to alignment and finally to generalization. This staged learning process enables search agents to internalize query quality improvement progressively, enhancing their overall performance. v. Empirical Validation Across Diverse Benchmarks The paper presents extensive experimental results demonstrating SmartSearch's superior performance across multiple challenging knowledge-intensive tasks and web exploration scenarios. This empirical validation highlights the framework's robustness and effectiveness in real-world applications, showcasing its potential impact on future research in search agents and information retrieval.",

      "abstract": "Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has become a prominent paradigm for scaling Large Language Models (LLMs). Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), such as LoRA, is widely adopted to adapt pretrained MoE LLMs to downstream tasks. However, existing approaches assign identical LoRA ranks to all experts, overlooking the intrinsic functional specialization within MoE LLMs. This uniform allocation leads to resource mismatch, task-relevant experts are under-provisioned while less relevant ones receive redundant parameters. We propose a Dynamic Rank LoRA framework named DR-LoRA, which dynamically grows expert LoRA ranks during fine-tuning based on task-specific demands. DR-LoRA employs an Expert Saliency Scoring mechanism that integrates expert routing frequency and LoRA rank importance to quantify each expert's demand for additional capacity. Experts with higher saliency scores are prioritized for rank expansion, enabling the automatic formation of a heterogeneous rank distribution tailored to the target task. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that DR-LoRA consistently outperforms standard LoRA and static allocation strategies under the same parameter budget, achieving superior task performance with more efficient parameter utilization.",

      "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as intelligent agents that reason, plan, and interact with their environments. To effectively scale to long-horizon scenarios, a key capability for such agents is a memory mechanism that can retain, organize, and retrieve past experiences to support downstream decision-making. However, most existing approaches organize and store memories in a flat manner and rely on simple similarity-based retrieval techniques. Even when structured memory is introduced, existing methods often struggle to explicitly capture the logical relationships among experiences or memory units. Moreover, memory access is largely detached from the constructed structure and still depends on shallow semantic retrieval, preventing agents from reasoning logically over long-horizon dependencies. In this work, we propose CompassMem, an event-centric memory framework inspired by Event Segmentation Theory. CompassMem organizes memory as an Event Graph by incrementally segmenting experiences into events and linking them through explicit logical relations. This graph serves as a logic map, enabling agents to perform structured and goal-directed navigation over memory beyond superficial retrieval, progressively gathering valuable memories to support long-horizon reasoning. Experiments on LoCoMo and NarrativeQA demonstrate that CompassMem consistently improves both retrieval and reasoning performance across multiple backbone models.",

      "abstract": "Real-time multimodal auto-completion is essential for digital assistants, chatbots, design tools, and healthcare consultations, where user inputs rely on shared visual context. We introduce Multimodal Auto-Completion (MAC), a task that predicts upcoming characters in live chats using partially typed text and visual cues. Unlike traditional text-only auto-completion (TAC), MAC grounds predictions in multimodal context to better capture user intent. To enable this task, we adapt MMDialog and ImageChat to create benchmark datasets. We evaluate leading vision-language models (VLMs) against strong textual baselines, highlighting trade-offs in accuracy and efficiency. We present Router-Suggest, a router framework that dynamically selects between textual models and VLMs based on dialog context, along with a lightweight variant for resource-constrained environments. Router-Suggest achieves a 2.3x to 10x speedup over the best-performing VLM. A user study shows that VLMs significantly excel over textual models on user satisfaction, notably saving user typing effort and improving the quality of completions in multi-turn conversations. These findings underscore the need for multimodal context in auto-completions, leading to smarter, user-aware assistants.",

      "title": "The Persona Paradox: Medical Personas as Behavioral Priors in Clinical Language Models",
      "abstract": "This paper investigates how \"persona conditioning\" (e.g., instructing an LLM to act as a specific medical professional) impacts clinical decision-making. The authors challenge the assumption that assigning a medical persona consistently improves accuracy or safety, labeling this inconsistency the \"Persona Paradox.\" Key Insights: Non-Monotonic Effects: Assigning a medical persona (like an Emergency Department physician) does not always improve performance. It acts as a behavioral prior that can help in some contexts but hurt in others. The Context Gap: Medical personas improved accuracy and calibration by up to 20% in critical-care tasks (triage) but degraded performance by a similar margin in primary-care settings. Interaction Styles: Adding styles such as \"bold\" or \"cautious\" changes the model’s risk propensity, but these effects vary widely across base models. The Alignment Gap: While \"LLM judges\" preferred medical personas for safety-critical cases, human clinicians were much more skeptical. Human experts showed low confidence in the AI's reasoning quality in 95.9% of cases, despite moderate agreement on safety compliance. Conclusion The study concludes that personas are not \"expertise switches\" but rather priors that introduce context-dependent trade-offs. Relying on personas for clinical safety is risky because they do not provide a universal guarantee of better judgment. Personas should be used with caution in high-stakes medicine, as they can inadvertently trigger biases or performance drops depending on the specific clinical task.",

      "abstract": "As LLM-based agents are increasingly used in long-term interactions, cumulative memory is critical for enabling personalization and maintaining stylistic consistency. However, most existing systems adopt an ``all-or-nothing'' approach to memory usage: incorporating all relevant past information can lead to Memory Anchoring, where the agent is trapped by past interactions, while excluding memory entirely results in under-utilization and the loss of important interaction history. We show that an agent's reliance on memory can be modeled as an explicit and user-controllable dimension. We first introduce a behavioral metric of memory dependence to quantify the influence of past interactions on current outputs. We then propose Steerable Memory Agent, SteeM, a framework that allows users to dynamically regulate memory reliance, ranging from a fresh-start mode that promotes innovation to a high-fidelity mode that closely follows interaction history. Experiments across different scenarios demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms conventional prompting and rigid memory masking strategies, yielding a more nuanced and effective control for personalized human-agent collaboration.",

Training and evaluating agents on complex agentic tasks such as software engineering and computer use requires not only efficient model computation but also sophisticated infrastructure capable of coordinating vast agent-environment interactions. However, no open-source infrastructure can effectively support large-scale training and evaluation on such complex agentic tasks. To address this challenge, we present MegaFlow, a large-scale distributed orchestration system that enables efficient scheduling, resource allocation, and fine-grained task management for agent-environment workloads. MegaFlow abstracts agent training infrastructure into three independent services (Model Service, Agent Service, and Environment Service) that interact through unified interfaces, enabling independent scaling and flexible resource allocation across diverse agent-environment configurations. In our agent training deployments, MegaFlow successfully orchestrates tens of thousands of concurrent agent tasks while maintaining high system stability and achieving efficient resource utilization. By enabling such large-scale agent training, MegaFlow addresses a critical infrastructure gap in the emerging agentic AI landscape.",

      "abstract": "Most current TIR work only focuses on the accuracy of agents in downstream tasks, while lacking calibration of the agents' behavioral patterns in TIR tasks. To address this issue, we first quantitatively analyze several possible erroneous behavioral patterns in current TIR tasks, and classify them into two categories: \"improper tool use\" and \"flawed reasoning logic\". Based on this, we propose ET-Agent, a framework that fully calibrates the behavioral patterns of agents when performing TIR tasks from both data and algorithm levels. On the data side, we propose a self-evolving data flywheel, which enhances the training data by leveraging the agent's own reflective exploration capabilities. On the algorithm side, we propose a behavioral calibration training framework. It performs rejection sampling fine-tuning on the basis of enhanced training data to broaden the agent's exploration of the action space. Subsequently, we implement iterative behavioral calibration reinforcement learning to calibrate the actions of the fine-tuned agent to the optimal behavioral pattern. Our contributions are listed as follows: We provide a comprehensive quantitative analysis of erroneous behavioral patterns in TIR. Inspired by this, we propose ET-Agent, a framework for optimizing TIR's behavioral patterns. We introduce a self-evolving data flywheel, an iterative loop where the model continuously refines its previous trajectories. This mechanism effectively unfolds the model's action space coverage beyond its initial exploration. Based on the flywheel, we present a behavior calibration training framework with two phases, aiming to calibrate the model's exploration in tool-use action space to optimal trajectories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ET-Agent substantially improves behavioral efficiency, reasoning conciseness, and execution success rates while maintaining high accuracy.",

      "abstract": "Current approaches to memory in Large Language Models (LLMs) predominantly rely on static Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which often results in scattered retrieval and fails to capture the structural dependencies required for complex reasoning. For autonomous agents, these passive and flat architectures lack the cognitive organization necessary to model the dynamic and associative nature of long-term interaction. To address this, we propose Structured Episodic Event Memory (SEEM), a hierarchical framework that synergizes a graph memory layer for relational facts with a dynamic episodic memory layer for narrative progression. Grounded in cognitive frame theory, SEEM transforms interaction streams into structured Episodic Event Frames (EEFs) anchored by precise provenance pointers. Furthermore, we introduce an agentic associative fusion and Reverse Provenance Expansion (RPE) mechanism to reconstruct coherent narrative contexts from fragmented evidence. Experimental results on the LoCoMo and LongMemEval benchmarks demonstrate that SEEM significantly outperforms baselines, enabling agents to maintain superior narrative coherence and logical consistency.",

Using community-validated quality signals and an LLM-accelerated, human-verified pipeline, we trace Oral and Spotlight papers across NeurIPS, ICML, and ICLR (2023-2025) to its key predecessors, articulating specific reasoning links in a structured format. Our analysis identifies 15 distinct thinking patterns, with three dominant strategies accounting for 52.7%: Gap-Driven Reframing (24.2%), Cross-Domain Synthesis (18.0%), and Representation Shift (10.5%). The most powerful innovation recipes combine multiple patterns: Gap-Driven Reframing + Representation Shift, Cross-Domain Synthesis + Representation Shift, and Gap-Driven Reframing + Cross-Domain Synthesis.

      "title": "How Do Large Language Models Learn Concepts During Continual Pre-Training?",
      "abstract": "Human beings primarily understand the world through concepts (e.g., dog), abstract mental representations that structure perception, reasoning, and learning. However, how large language models (LLMs) acquire, retain, and forget such concepts during continual pretraining remains poorly understood. In this work, we study how individual concepts are acquired and forgotten, as well as how multiple concepts interact through interference and synergy. We link these behavioral dynamics to LLMs' internal Concept Circuits, computational subgraphs associated with specific concepts, and incorporate Graph Metrics to characterize circuit structure. Our analysis reveals: (1) LLMs concept circuits provide a non-trivial, statistically significant signal of concept learning and forgetting; (2) Concept circuits exhibit a stage-wise temporal pattern during continual pretraining, with an early increase followed by gradual decrease and stabilization; (3) concepts with larger learning gains tend to exhibit greater forgetting under subsequent training; (4) semantically similar concepts induce stronger interference than weakly related ones; (5) conceptual knowledge differs in their transferability, with some significantly facilitating the learning of others. Together, our findings offer a circuit-level view of concept learning dynamics and inform the design of more interpretable and robust concept-aware training strategies for LLMs.",

      "abstract": "Post-training of large language models routinely interleaves supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with reinforcement learning (RL). These two methods have different objectives: SFT minimizes the cross-entropy loss between model outputs and expert responses, while RL maximizes reward signals derived from human preferences or rule-based verifiers. Modern reasoning models have widely adopted the practice of alternating SFT and RL training. However, there is no theoretical account of whether they can be decoupled. We prove that decoupling is impossible in either order: (1) SFT-then-RL coupling: RL increases SFT loss under SFT optimality and (2) RL-then-SFT coupling: SFT lowers the reward achieved by RL. Experiments on Qwen3-0.6B confirm the predicted degradation, verifying that SFT and RL cannot be separated without loss of prior performance in the post-training pipeline.",

      "abstract": "In this work, we investigate the impact of CoT on Fine-Grained Visual Classification (FGVC), revealing a paradox: the degradation in FGVC performance due to CoT is primarily driven by reasoning length, with longer textual reasoning consistently reducing classification accuracy. We introduce the concept of the \"Cost of Thinking\" to describe this phenomenon. Building on this insight, we propose two key contributions: (1) MRN, a normalization method for multi-reward optimization that balances heterogeneous reward signals; and (2) ReFine-RFT, a framework that integrates ensemble rewards with MRN to constrain reasoning length while providing dense, accuracy-oriented feedback. Our extensive experiments across multiple FGVC benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving state-of-the-art performance.",

Self-consistency (majority voting over multiple reasoning paths) reliably boosts LLM accuracy on reasoning tasks. But does getting the right answer more often mean the model is actually reasoning better? We test 4 frontier models (GPT-5.2, Claude Opus 4.5, Gemini-3-flash-preview, and DeepSeek-v3.2) on 100 GSM8K problems and find a surprising tradeoff. Accuracy gains from self-consistency don't necessarily translate to more faithful reasoning. This discovery has important implications for AI safety.

Ensuring safe and reliable operation in these human-populated environments demands accurate perception of human poses and actions from an aerial viewpoint. This perspective challenges existing methods with low resolution, steep viewing angles and (self-)occlusion, especially if the application demands realtime feasible models. We train and deploy FlyPose, a lightweight top-down human pose estimation pipeline for aerial imagery. Through multi-dataset training, we achieve an average improvement of 6.8 mAP in person detection across the test-sets of Manipal-UAV, VisDrone, HIT-UAV as well as our custom dataset. For 2D human pose estimation we report an improvement of 16.3 mAP on the challenging UAV-Human dataset. FlyPose runs with an inference latency of ∼20 milliseconds including preprocessing on a Jetson Orin AGX Developer Kit and is deployed onboard a quadrotor UAV during flight experiments. We also publish FlyPose-104, a small but challenging aerial human pose estimation dataset, that includes manual annotations from difficult aerial perspectives: https://github.com/farooqhassaan/FlyPose .",

      "abstract": "Generative spoken language models pretrained on large-scale raw audio can continue a speech prompt with appropriate content while preserving attributes like speaker and emotion, serving as foundation models for spoken dialogue. In prior literature, these models are often evaluated using “global token perplexity”, which directly applies the text perplexity formulation to speech tokens. However, this practice overlooks fundamental differences between speech and text modalities, possibly leading to an underestimation of the speech characteristics. In this work, we propose a variety of likelihood- and generative-based evaluation methods that serve in place of naive global token perplexity. We demonstrate that the proposed evaluations more faithfully reflect perceived generation quality, as evidenced by stronger correlations with human-rated mean opinion scores (MOS). When assessed under the new metrics, the relative performance landscape of spoken language models is reshaped, revealing a significantly reduced gap between the best-performing model and the human topline. Together, these results suggest that appropriate evaluation is critical for accurately assessing progress in spoken language modeling.",

      "abstract": "Video object segmentation methods like SAM2 achieve strong performance through memory-based architectures but struggle under large viewpoint changes due to reliance on appearance features. Traditional 3D instance segmentation methods address viewpoint consistency but require camera poses, depth maps, and expensive preprocessing. We introduce 3AM, a training-time enhancement that integrates 3D-aware features from MUSt3R into SAM2. Our lightweight Feature Merger fuses multi-level MUSt3R features that encode implicit geometric correspondence. Combined with SAM2's appearance features, the model achieves geometry-consistent recognition grounded in both spatial position and visual similarity. We propose a field-of-view aware sampling strategy ensuring frames observe spatially consistent object regions for reliable 3D correspondence learning. Critically, our method requires only RGB input at inference, with no camera poses or preprocessing. On challenging datasets with wide-baseline motion (ScanNet++, Replica), 3AM substantially outperforms SAM2 and extensions, achieving 90.6% IoU and 71.7% Positive IoU on ScanNet++'s Selected Subset, improving over state-of-the-art VOS methods by +15.9 and +30.4 points.",

      "abstract": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines must address challenges beyond simple single-document retrieval, such as interpreting visual elements (tables, charts, images), synthesizing information across documents, and providing accurate source grounding. Existing benchmarks fail to capture this complexity, often focusing on textual data, single-document comprehension, or evaluating retrieval and generation in isolation. We introduce ViDoRe v3, a comprehensive multimodal RAG benchmark featuring multi-type queries over visually rich document corpora. It covers 10 datasets across diverse professional domains, comprising ~26,000 document pages paired with 3,099 human-verified queries, each available in 6 languages. Through 12,000 hours of human annotation effort, we provide high-quality annotations for retrieval relevance, bounding box localization, and verified reference answers. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art RAG pipelines reveals that visual retrievers outperform textual ones, late-interaction models and textual reranking substantially improve performance, and hybrid or purely visual contexts enhance answer generation quality. However, current models still struggle with non-textual elements, open-ended queries, and fine-grained visual grounding. To encourage progress in addressing these challenges, the benchmark is released under a commercially permissive license at https://huggingface.co/vidore .",

      "abstract": "Improving the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) has largely relied on iterative self-training with model-generated data. While effective at boosting accuracy, existing approaches primarily reinforce successful reasoning paths, incurring a substantial calibration cost: models become overconfident and lose the ability to represent uncertainty. This failure has been characterized as a form of model collapse in alignment, where predictive distributions degenerate toward low-variance point estimates. We address this issue by reframing reasoning training as an epistemic learning problem, in which models must learn not only how to reason, but also when their reasoning should be trusted. We propose epistemicallycalibrated reasoning (EPICAR) as a training objective that jointly optimizes reasoning performance and calibration, and instantiate it within an iterative supervised fine-tuning framework using explicit self-evaluation signals. Experiments on Llama-3 and Qwen-3 families demonstrate that our approach achieves Paretosuperiority over standard baselines in both accuracy and calibration, particularly in models with sufficient reasoning capacity (e.g., 3B+). This framework generalizes effectively to OOD mathematical reasoning (GSM8K) and code generation (MBPP). Ultimately, our approach enables a 3× reduction in inference compute, matching the K = 30 performance of STaR with only K = 10 samples in capable models",

      "abstract": "The rapid evolution of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has advanced workflow automation; however, existing research mainly targets performance upper bounds in static environments, overlooking robustness for stochastic real-world deployment. We identify three key challenges: dynamic task scheduling, active exploration under uncertainty, and continuous learning from experience. To bridge this gap, we introduce \\method{}, a dynamic evaluation environment that simulates a \"trainee\" agent continuously exploring a novel setting. Unlike traditional benchmarks, \\method{} evaluates agents along three dimensions: (1) context-aware scheduling for streaming tasks with varying priorities; (2) prudent information acquisition to reduce hallucination via active exploration; and (3) continuous evolution by distilling generalized strategies from rule-based, dynamically generated tasks. Experiments show that cutting-edge agents have significant deficiencies in dynamic environments, especially in active exploration and continual learning. Our work establishes a framework for assessing agent reliability, shifting evaluation from static tests to realistic, production-oriented scenarios.

For task construction, we propose a persona-driven pipeline generating realistic, complex research tasks anchored in diverse user profiles, applying a two-stage filter Task Qualification and Search Necessity to retain only tasks requiring multi-source evidence integration and external retrieval. For evaluation, we propose an agentic pipeline with two components: an Adaptive Point-wise Quality Evaluation that dynamically derives task-specific evaluation dimensions, criteria, and weights conditioned on each generated task, and an Active Fact-Checking that autonomously extracts and verifies report statements via web search, even when citations are missing.",

      "abstract": "Large Language Model (LLM) Agents exhibit inherent reasoning abilities through the collaboration of multiple tools. However, during agent inference, existing methods often suffer from (i) locally myopic generation, due to the absence of lookahead, and (ii) trajectory instability, where minor early errors can escalate into divergent reasoning paths. These issues make it difficult to balance global effectiveness and computational efficiency. To address these two issues, we propose meta-adaptive exploration with LLM agents, a meta-adaptive reasoning framework based on LLM Agents that flexibly integrates tool execution and reasoning planning. MAXS employs a lookahead strategy to extend reasoning paths a few steps ahead, estimating the advantage value of tool usage, and combines step consistency variance and inter-step trend slopes to jointly select stable, consistent, and high-value reasoning steps. Additionally, we introduce a trajectory convergence mechanism that controls computational cost by halting further rollouts once path consistency is achieved, enabling a balance between resource efficiency and global effectiveness in multi-tool reasoning. We conduct extensive empirical studies across three base models (MiMo-VL-7B, Qwen2.5-VL-7B, Qwen2.5-VL-32B) and five datasets, demonstrating that MAXS consistently outperforms existing methods in both performance and inference efficiency. Further analysis confirms the effectiveness of our lookahead strategy and tool usage.",

To address this gap, we propose A3-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate scientific reasoning through dual-scale memory-driven activation, grounded in Anchor and Attractor Activation. First, we annotate 2,198 science reasoning problems across domains using the SAPM process(subject, anchor & attractor, problem, and memory developing). Second, we introduce a dual-scale memory evaluation framework utilizing anchors and attractors, along with the AAUI(Anchor--Attractor Utilization Index) metric to measure memory activation rates. Finally, through experiments with various base models and paradigms, we validate A3-Bench and analyze how memory activation impacts reasoning performance, providing insights into memory-driven scientific reasoning.",

      "abstract": "In this report, we introduce DASD-4B-Thinking, a lightweight yet highly capable, fully open-source reasoning model. It achieves SOTA performance among open-source models of comparable scale across challenging benchmarks in mathematics, scientific reasoning, and code generation -- even outperforming several larger models. We begin by critically reexamining a widely adopted distillation paradigm in the community: SFT on teacher-generated responses, also known as sequence-level distillation. Although a series of recent works following this scheme have demonstrated remarkable efficiency and strong empirical performance, they are primarily grounded in the SFT perspective. Consequently, these approaches focus predominantly on designing heuristic rules for SFT data filtering, while largely overlooking the core principle of distillation itself -- enabling the student model to learn the teacher's full output distribution so as to inherit its generalization capability. Specifically, we identify three critical limitations in current practice: i) Inadequate representation of the teacher's sequence-level distribution; ii) Misalignment between the teacher's output distribution and the student's learning capacity; and iii) Exposure bias arising from teacher-forced training versus autoregressive inference. In summary, these shortcomings reflect a systemic absence of explicit teacher-student interaction throughout the distillation process, leaving the essence of distillation underexploited. To address these issues, we propose several methodological innovations that collectively form an enhanced sequence-level distillation training pipeline. Remarkably, DASD-4B-Thinking obtains competitive results using only 448K training samples -- an order of magnitude fewer than those employed by most existing open-source efforts. To support community research, we publicly release our models and the training dataset.",

In this paper, we challenge the assumption that parameter scaling is the only path to medical precision. We introduce SkinFlow, a framework that treats diagnosis as an optimization of visual information transmission efficiency. Our approach utilizes a Virtual-Width Dynamic Vision Encoder (DVE) to \"unfold\" complex pathological manifolds without physical parameter expansion, coupled with a two-stage Reinforcement Learning strategy. This strategy sequentially aligns explicit medical descriptions (Stage I) and reconstructs implicit diagnostic textures (Stage II) within a constrained semantic space. Furthermore, we propose a clinically grounded evaluation protocol that prioritizes diagnostic safety and hierarchical relevance over rigid label matching. Empirical results are compelling: our 7B model establishes a new state-of-the-art on the Fitzpatrick17k benchmark, achieving a +12.06% gain in Top-1 accuracy and a +28.57% boost in Top-6 accuracy over the massive general-purpose models (e.g., Qwen3VL-235B and GPT-5.2).

Through a robustness-oriented training algorithm, the model learns to perform answer decoding guided by explicit indicators, rather than relying solely on prompt engineering or internal attention scores. This approach significantly enhances the system's controllability, accuracy, and robustness across various noisy environments. Take Away: Opening LLM rather than solely relying on prompt engineering is important to improve the system’s robustness, since we cannot expect LLMs’ implicit identification to be always correct. The external indicators, e.g., relevance score, confidence feature, faithful factors, are useful to incorporate with LLMs’ internal information processing mechanism, e.g., attention, for output decoding, where the key problem is to obtain and integrate these indicators into LLMs with a sophisticated training algorithm (during post-training). Experimental results show the robustness enhancement in different levels of noisy environments of our initial investigation of OpenDecoder. An ideal situation is that the LLM can understand to what extent to rely on external retrieved knowledge and internal parametric knowledge during answer decoding.",

      "abstract": "Experience intervention in web agents emerges as a promising technical paradigm, enhancing agent interaction capabilities by providing valuable insights from accumulated experiences. However, existing methods predominantly inject experience passively as global context before task execution, struggling to adapt to dynamically changing contextual observations during agent-environment interaction. We propose ExpSeek, which shifts experience toward step-level proactive seeking: (1) estimating step-level entropy thresholds to determine intervention timing using the model's intrinsic signals; (2) designing step-level tailor-designed experience content. Experiments on Qwen3-8B and 32B models across four challenging web agent benchmarks demonstrate that ExpSeek achieves absolute improvements of 9.3% and 7.5%, respectively. Our experiments validate the feasibility and advantages of entropy as a self-triggering signal, reveal that even a 4B small-scale experience model can significantly boost the performance of larger agent models.",

      "abstract": "DeepSeek got it half right with their mHC paper: stability matters for scaling. But they only measure stability DURING training. What about the stability of what models LEARN? I built Shesha to measure this - a geometric stability metric with SOTA results across AI Safety , Constitutional AI , Model selection , and CRISPR perturbation analysis. The core insight: Most evals check external similarity (does output X match Y?). But imagine a massive library where someone reshuffled all the books. A content-based audit would say that nothing's wrong since the inventory is identical. But the library is useless since nothing can be found. That's the gap Shesha fills. The implications are broad with SOTA results across 4 domains : AI Safety - Shesha is the best canary in the coal mine . Shesha outperforms CKA and Procrustes on drift detection. Detects 2x more drift than CKA, triggers earlier 73% of the time, catches subtle LoRA shifts at 90% sensitivity (5% FPR) - with only 7% false alarms vs Procrustes' 44%. Constitutional AI - Shesha provides the best steering prediction . Constitutional AI needs models you can actually steer. Most metrics ask: \"Are classes separable?\" Wrong question! Shesha asks: \"Is that separation STABLE under perturbation?\" Tested on 35-69 embedding models across 3 experiments. Shesha outperforms Fisher discriminant, silhouette score, Procrustes, and anisotropy. The correlations with intervention success are rho=0.89-0.96, and the partial correlations after controlling for separability are rho=0.67-0.76. Stability ≠ separability. Model selection - Shesha exposes what LogME misses . The DINO Paradox - best transfer scores, worst geometric stability. Tested 94 vision models on 6 datasets: DINOv2 ranked #1 in LogME on 4/6 datasets but last or near last in stability on 5/6. SOTA transfer incurs a \"geometric tax.\" CRISPR perturbations - Shesha serves as a new filter for target selection . CRISPR screens find hits by magnitude, but magnitude alone can't distinguish clean lineage drivers from promiscuous regulators. Shesha adds precision. Tested on 811 perturbations, Shesha showed uniformly positive magnitude-stability correlations ranging from rho=0.746 in high-variance screens to rho=0.963 in cleaner activation settings. Notably, in discordant cases, Shesha separates KLF1 (stable, specific) from CEBPA (strong but messy) purely from geometry. Additional validation in neuroscience: Geometric stability predicted neural-behavioral coupling (rho=0.18, p=0.005) in Neuropixels data. Centroid drift showed no relationship (rho=0.00). Stability ≠ consistency.

Current methods lack explicit mechanisms for guiding diverse exploration and instead prioritize optimization efficiency and performance over diversity. This paper proposes an RL framework structured around a semi-structured long Chain-of-Thought (CoT), in which the generation process is decomposed into explicitly planned intermediate steps.

      "abstract": "Critique-guided reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for training LLM agents by augmenting sparse outcome rewards with natural-language feedback. However, current methods often rely on static or offline critic models, which fail to adapt as the policy evolves. In on-policy RL, the agent's error patterns shift over time, causing stationary critics to become stale and providing feedback of diminishing utility. To address this, we introduce ECHO (Evolving Critic for Hindsight-Guided Optimization)}, a framework that jointly optimizes the policy and critic through a synchronized co-evolutionary loop. ECHO utilizes a cascaded rollout mechanism where the critic generates multiple diagnoses for an initial trajectory, followed by policy refinement to enable group-structured advantage estimation. We address the challenge of learning plateaus via a saturation-aware gain shaping objective, which rewards the critic for inducing incremental improvements in high-performing trajectories. By employing dual-track GRPO updates, ECHO ensures the critic's feedback stays synchronized with the evolving policy. Experimental results show that ECHO yields more stable training and higher long-horizon task success across open-world environments.",

This paper introduces a semantic, intent-driven scheduling paradigm for cluster systems using Natural Language Processing. The system employs a Large Language Model (LLM) integrated via a Kubernetes scheduler extender to interpret natural language allocation hint annotations for soft affinity preferences. A prototype featuring a cluster state cache and an intent analyzer (using AWS Bedrock) was developed. Empirical evaluation demonstrated high LLM parsing accuracy (>95% Subset Accuracy on an evaluation ground-truth dataset) for top-tier models like Amazon Nova Pro/Premier and Mistral Pixtral Large, significantly outperforming a baseline engine. Scheduling quality tests across six scenarios showed the prototype achieved superior or equivalent placement compared to standard Kubernetes configurations, particularly excelling in complex and quantitative scenarios and handling conflicting soft preferences. The results validate using LLMs for accessible scheduling but highlight limitations like synchronous LLM latency, suggesting asynchronous processing for production readiness. This work confirms the viability of semantic soft affinity for simplifying workload orchestration.",

      "abstract": "The quality of subword tokenization is critical for Large Language Models, yet evaluating tokenizers for morphologically rich Uralic languages is hampered by the lack of clean morpheme lexicons. We introduce SampoNLP, a corpus-free toolkit for morphological lexicon creation using MDL-inspired Self-Referential Atomicity Scoring, which filters composite forms through internal structural cues - suited for low-resource settings. Using the high-purity lexicons generated by SampoNLP for Finnish, Hungarian, and Estonian, we conduct a systematic evaluation of BPE tokenizers across a range of vocabulary sizes (8k-256k). We propose a unified metric, the Integrated Performance Score (IPS), to navigate the trade-off between morpheme coverage and over-splitting. By analyzing the IPS curves, we identify the \"elbow points\" of diminishing returns and provide the first empirically grounded recommendations for optimal vocabulary sizes (k) in these languages. Our study not only offers practical guidance but also quantitatively demonstrates the limitations of standard BPE for highly agglutinative languages.

      "abstract": "Vision-Language Pre-training (VLP) models demonstrate strong performance across various downstream tasks by learning from large-scale image-text pairs through contrastive pretraining. The release of extensive English image-text datasets (e.g., COYO-700M and LAION-400M) has enabled widespread adoption of models such as CLIP and SigLIP in tasks including cross-modal retrieval and image captioning. However, the advancement of Chinese vision-language pretraining has substantially lagged behind, due to the scarcity of high-quality Chinese image-text data. To address this gap, we develop a comprehensive pipeline for constructing a high-quality Chinese cross-modal dataset. As a result, we propose DanQing, which contains 100 million image-text pairs collected from Common Crawl. Different from existing datasets, DanQing is curated through a more rigorous selection process, yielding superior data quality. Moreover, DanQing is primarily built from 2024-2025 web data, enabling models to better capture evolving semantic trends and thus offering greater practical utility. We compare DanQing with existing datasets by continual pre-training of the SigLIP2 model. Experimental results show that DanQing consistently achieves superior performance across a range of Chinese downstream tasks, including zero-shot classification, cross-modal retrieval, and LMM-based evaluations. To facilitate further research in Chinese vision-language pre-training, we will open-source the DanQing dataset under the Creative Common CC-BY 4.0 license.",

      "abstract": "💡 Overview We propose MatchTIR, a fine-grained reinforcement learning framework specifically designed for Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR). The core principle of MatchTIR is to introduce precise supervision via bipartite matching-based turn-level reward assignment, allowing the model to distinguish between effective, redundant, or erroneous tool calls in multi-turn scenarios. 🔥Key Insights We highlight that existing RL methods assign uniform advantages to all steps, failing to distinguish between critical, redundant, or erroneous tool calls in long-horizon trajectories. We reformulate credit assignment as a bipartite matching problem between predicted and ground-truth tool calls. By constructing a matching matrix, we get the precise reward. We introduce two matching mechanisms: Hard Assignment (KM algorithm) for strict one-to-one mapping and Soft Assignment (Optimal Transport) for probabilistic alignment, providing dense and verifiable supervision signals. To balance local precision with global success, we propose a scheme that integrates trajectory-level signals (overall quality) with turn-level advantages (individual step contribution via discounted rewards). Extensive experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of MatchTIR. Notably, our 4B model outperforms larger 8B competitors, particularly in long-horizon and multi-turn tasks. 🔧✨ All the code, datasets and model checkpoints of MatchTIR are fully open-sourced: Github: https://github.com/quchangle1/MatchTIR Datasets & Models: https://huggingface.co/collections/ChangleQu/matchtir",

      "abstract": "The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has produced substantial gains in reasoning, perception, and generative capability across language and vision. However, whether these advances yield commensurate improvements in safety remains unclear, in part due to fragmented evaluation practices limited to single modalities or threat models. In this report, we present an integrated safety evaluation of 7 frontier models: GPT-5.2, Gemini 3 Pro, Qwen3-VL, Doubao 1.8, Grok 4.1 Fast, Nano Banana Pro, and Seedream 4.5. We evaluate each model across language, vision-language, and image generation settings using a unified protocol that integrates benchmark evaluation, adversarial evaluation, multilingual evaluation, and compliance evaluation. Aggregating our evaluations into safety leaderboards and model safety profiles across multiple evaluation modes reveals a sharply heterogeneous safety landscape. While GPT-5.2 demonstrates consistently strong and balanced safety performance across evaluations, other models exhibit pronounced trade-offs among benchmark safety, adversarial alignment, multilingual generalization, and regulatory compliance. Both language and vision-language modalities show significant vulnerability under adversarial evaluation, with all models degrading substantially despite strong results on standard benchmarks. Text-to-image models achieve relatively stronger alignment in regulated visual risk categories, yet remain brittle under adversarial or semantically ambiguous prompts. Overall, these results show that safety in frontier models is inherently multidimensional--shaped by modality, language, and evaluation scheme, underscoring the need for standardized safety evaluations to accurately assess real-world risk and guide responsible model development and deployment.",

      "abstract": "Generating molecules that satisfy precise numeric constraints over multiple physicochemical properties is critical and challenging. Although large language models (LLMs) are expressive, they struggle with precise multiobjective control and numeric reasoning without external structure and feedback. We introduce M4olGen, a fragment-level, retrievalaugmented, two-stage framework for molecule generation under multi-property constraints.Stage I: Prototype generation: a multiagent reasoner performs retrieval-anchored, fragment-level edits to produce a candidate near the feasible region. Stage II: RL-based fine-grained optimization: a fragment-level optimizer trained with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) applies one- or multihop refinements to explicitly minimize the property errors toward our target while regulating edit complexity and deviation from the prototype. A large, automatically curated dataset with reasoning chains of fragment edits and measured property deltas underpins both stages, enabling deterministic, reproducible supervision and controllable multi-hop reasoning. Unlike prior work, our framework better reasons about molecules by leveraging fragments and supports controllable refinement toward numeric targets. Experiments on generation under two sets of property constraints (QED, LogP, Molecular Weight and HOMO, LUMO) show consistent gains in validity and precise satisfaction of multi-property targets, outperforming strong LLMs and graph-based algorithms.",

      "abstract": "We present a family of open-source Music Foundation Models designed to advance large-scale music understanding and generation across diverse tasks and modalities. Our framework consists of four major components: (1) HeartCLAP, an audio\u0002text alignment model; (2) HeartTranscriptor, a robust lyric recognition model optimized for real-world music scenarios; and (3) HeartCodec, a low-frame-rate (12.5 Hz) yet high-fidelity music codec tokenizer that captures long-range musical structure while preserving fine-grained acoustic details and enabling efficient autoregressive modeling; (4) HeartMuLa, an LLM-based song generation model capable of synthesizing high-fidelity music under rich, user-controllable conditions (e.g., textual style descriptions, lyrics, and reference audio). In addition, it provides two specialized modes: (i) fine-grained musical attribute control, which allows users to specify the style of different song sections (e.g., intro, verse, chorus) using natural language prompts; and (ii) short, engaging music generation, which is suitable as background music for short videos. Lastly, HeartMuLa improves significantly when scaled to 7B parameters. For the first time, we show that a Suno-level, commercial-grade system can be reproduced using academic-scale data and GPU resources. We expect these foundation models to serve as strong baselines for future research and to facilitate practical applications in multimodal content production.",

      "title": "PRL: Process Reward Learning Improves LLMs' Reasoning Ability and Broadens the Reasoning Boundary",
      "abstract": "Abstract Improving the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) has been a continuous topic recently. But most relevant works are based on outcome rewards at the trajectory level, missing fine-grained supervision during the reasoning process. Other existing training frameworks that try to combine process signals together to optimize LLMs also rely heavily on tedious additional steps like MCTS, training a separate reward model, etc., doing harm to the training efficiency. Moreover, the intuition behind the process signals design lacks rigorous theoretical support, leaving the understanding of the optimization mechanism opaque. In this paper, we propose Process Reward Learning (PRL), which decomposes the entropy regularized reinforcement learning objective into intermediate steps, with rigorous process rewards that could be assigned to models accordingly. Starting from theoretical motivation, we derive the formulation of PRL that is essentially equivalent to the objective of reward maximization plus a KL-divergence penalty term between the policy model and a reference model. However, PRL could turn the outcome reward into process supervision signals, which helps better guide the exploration during RL optimization. From our experiment results, we demonstrate that PRL not only improves the average performance for LLMs' reasoning ability measured by average @ n, but also broadens the reasoning boundary by improving the pass @ n metric. Extensive experiments show that the effectiveness of PRL could be verified and generalized.",

      "abstract": "Really interesting and timely work—agent “skills” seem like a rapidly growing supply-chain attack surface, and it’s refreshing to see a large-scale empirical analysis rather than a purely conceptual treatment. The scale and methodology (tens of thousands of skills analyzed using a combined static and LLM-based pipeline) are particularly compelling, and the 14-pattern, four-category vulnerability taxonomy helps make the risk landscape much more concrete. The reported numbers are striking: roughly a quarter of skills containing vulnerabilities, with a non-trivial fraction exhibiting high-severity patterns suggestive of malicious behavior, which strongly motivates the need for better ecosystem defenses. It would be interesting to learn more about how ambiguous cases were handled when separating malicious intent from accidental insecurity, whether vulnerability prevalence differs across marketplaces with different governance models, and how developers might practically use the detection results for remediation. The call for capability-based permission systems is persuasive, and additional discussion of concrete enforcement mechanisms (e.g., sandboxing, least-privilege access, signing, or dependency controls) would further strengthen the practical impact.",

      "abstract": "We present WildRayZer, a self-supervised framework for novel view synthesis (NVS) in dynamic environments where both the camera and objects move. Dynamic content breaks the multi-view consistency that static NVS models rely on, leading to ghosting, hallucinated geometry, and unstable pose estimation. WildRayZer addresses this by performing an analysis-by-synthesis test: a camera-only static renderer explains rigid structure, and its residuals reveal transient regions. From these residuals, we construct pseudo motion masks, distill a motion estimator, and use it to mask input tokens and gate loss gradients so supervision focuses on cross-view background completion. To enable large-scale training and evaluation, we curate Dynamic RealEstate10K (D-RE10K), a real-world dataset of 15K casually captured dynamic sequences, and D-RE10K-iPhone, a paired transient and clean benchmark for sparse-view transient-aware NVS. Experiments show that WildRayZer consistently outperforms optimization-based and feed-forward baselines in both transient-region removal and full-frame NVS quality with a single feed-forward pass.",

      "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit slash attention patterns, where attention scores concentrate along the Δ-th sub-diagonal for some offset Δ. These patterns play a key role in passing information across tokens. But why do they emerge? In this paper, we demystify the emergence of these Slash-Dominant Heads (SDHs) from both empirical and theoretical perspectives. First, by analyzing open-source LLMs, we find that SDHs are intrinsic to models and generalize to out-of-distribution prompts. To explain the intrinsic emergence, we analyze the queries, keys, and Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE), which jointly determine attention scores. Our empirical analysis reveals two characteristic conditions of SDHs: (1) Queries and keys are almost rank-one, and (2) RoPE is dominated by medium- and high-frequency components. Under these conditions, queries and keys are nearly identical across tokens, and interactions between medium- and high-frequency components of RoPE give rise to SDHs. Beyond empirical evidence, we theoretically show that these conditions are sufficient to ensure the emergence of SDHs by formalizing them as our modeling assumptions. Particularly, we analyze the training dynamics of a shallow Transformer equipped with RoPE under these conditions, and prove that models trained via gradient descent exhibit SDHs. The SDHs generalize to out-of-distribution prompts.",

      "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have become a mainstay for many everyday applications. However, as data evolve their knowledge quickly becomes outdated. Continual learning aims to update LLMs with new information without erasing previously acquired knowledge. Although methods such as full fine-tuning can incorporate new data, they are computationally expensive and prone to catastrophic forgetting, where prior knowledge is overwritten. Memory-augmented approaches address this by equipping LLMs with a memory bank, that is an external memory module which stores information for future use. However, these methods face a critical limitation, in particular, the memory bank constantly grows in the real-world scenario when large-scale data streams arrive. In this paper, we propose MBC, a model that compresses the memory bank through a codebook optimization strategy during online adaptation learning. To ensure stable learning, we also introduce an online resetting mechanism that prevents codebook collapse. In addition, we employ Key-Value Low-Rank Adaptation in the attention layers of the LLM, enabling efficient utilization of the compressed memory representations. Experiments with benchmark question-answering datasets demonstrate that MBC reduces the memory bank size to 0.3% when compared against the most competitive baseline, while maintaining high retention accuracy during online adaptation learning.

      "abstract": "Vision-Language Pre-training (VLP) models demonstrate strong performance across various downstream tasks by learning from large-scale image-text pairs through contrastive pretraining. The release of extensive English image-text datasets (e.g., COYO-700M and LAION-400M) has enabled widespread adoption of models such as CLIP and SigLIP in tasks including cross-modal retrieval and image captioning. However, the advancement of Chinese vision-language pretraining has substantially lagged behind, due to the scarcity of high-quality Chinese image-text data. To address this gap, we develop a comprehensive pipeline for constructing a high-quality Chinese cross-modal dataset. As a result, we propose DanQing, which contains 100 million image-text pairs collected from Common Crawl. Different from existing datasets, DanQing is curated through a more rigorous selection process, yielding superior data quality. Moreover, DanQing is primarily built from 2024-2025 web data, enabling models to better capture evolving semantic trends and thus offering greater practical utility. We compare DanQing with existing datasets by continual pre-training of the SigLIP2 model. Experimental results show that DanQing consistently achieves superior performance across a range of Chinese downstream tasks, including zero-shot classification, cross-modal retrieval, and LMM-based evaluations. To facilitate further research in Chinese vision-language pre-training, we will open-source the DanQing dataset under the Creative Common CC-BY 4.0 license.",

      "title": "MatchTIR: Fine-Grained Supervision for Tool-Integrated Reasoning via Bipartite Matching",
      "abstract": "💡 Overview We propose MatchTIR, a fine-grained reinforcement learning framework specifically designed for Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR). The core principle of MatchTIR is to introduce precise supervision via bipartite matching-based turn-level reward assignment, allowing the model to distinguish between effective, redundant, or erroneous tool calls in multi-turn scenarios. 🔥Key Insights We highlight that existing RL methods assign uniform advantages to all steps, failing to distinguish between critical, redundant, or erroneous tool calls in long-horizon trajectories. We reformulate credit assignment as a bipartite matching problem between predicted and ground-truth tool calls. By constructing a matching matrix, we get the precise reward. We introduce two matching mechanisms: Hard Assignment (KM algorithm) for strict one-to-one mapping and Soft Assignment (Optimal Transport) for probabilistic alignment, providing dense and verifiable supervision signals. To balance local precision with global success, we propose a scheme that integrates trajectory-level signals (overall quality) with turn-level advantages (individual step contribution via discounted rewards). Extensive experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of MatchTIR. Notably, our 4B model outperforms larger 8B competitors, particularly in long-horizon and multi-turn tasks. 🔧✨ All the code, datasets and model checkpoints of MatchTIR are fully open-sourced: Github: https://github.com/quchangle1/MatchTIR Datasets & Models: https://huggingface.co/collections/ChangleQu/matchtir",

      "abstract": "The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has produced substantial gains in reasoning, perception, and generative capability across language and vision. However, whether these advances yield commensurate improvements in safety remains unclear, in part due to fragmented evaluation practices limited to single modalities or threat models. In this report, we present an integrated safety evaluation of 7 frontier models: GPT-5.2, Gemini 3 Pro, Qwen3-VL, Doubao 1.8, Grok 4.1 Fast, Nano Banana Pro, and Seedream 4.5. We evaluate each model across language, vision-language, and image generation settings using a unified protocol that integrates benchmark evaluation, adversarial evaluation, multilingual evaluation, and compliance evaluation. Aggregating our evaluations into safety leaderboards and model safety profiles across multiple evaluation modes reveals a sharply heterogeneous safety landscape. While GPT-5.2 demonstrates consistently strong and balanced safety performance across evaluations, other models exhibit pronounced trade-offs among benchmark safety, adversarial alignment, multilingual generalization, and regulatory compliance. Both language and vision-language modalities show significant vulnerability under adversarial evaluation, with all models degrading substantially despite strong results on standard benchmarks. Text-to-image models achieve relatively stronger alignment in regulated visual risk categories, yet remain brittle under adversarial or semantically ambiguous prompts. Overall, these results show that safety in frontier models is inherently multidimensional--shaped by modality, language, and evaluation scheme, underscoring the need for standardized safety evaluations to accurately assess real-world risk and guide responsible model development and deployment.",

      "abstract": "Generating molecules that satisfy precise numeric constraints over multiple physicochemical properties is critical and challenging. Although large language models (LLMs) are expressive, they struggle with precise multiobjective control and numeric reasoning without external structure and feedback. We introduce M4olGen, a fragment-level, retrievalaugmented, two-stage framework for molecule generation under multi-property constraints.Stage I: Prototype generation: a multiagent reasoner performs retrieval-anchored, fragment-level edits to produce a candidate near the feasible region. Stage II: RL-based fine-grained optimization: a fragment-level optimizer trained with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) applies one- or multihop refinements to explicitly minimize the property errors toward our target while regulating edit complexity and deviation from the prototype. A large, automatically curated dataset with reasoning chains of fragment edits and measured property deltas underpins both stages, enabling deterministic, reproducible supervision and controllable multi-hop reasoning. Unlike prior work, our framework better reasons about molecules by leveraging fragments and supports controllable refinement toward numeric targets. Experiments on generation under two sets of property constraints (QED, LogP, Molecular Weight and HOMO, LUMO) show consistent gains in validity and precise satisfaction of multi-property targets, outperforming strong LLMs and graph-based algorithms.",

Our framework consists of four major components: (1) HeartCLAP, an audio\u0002text alignment model; (2) HeartTranscriptor, a robust lyric recognition model optimized for real-world music scenarios; and (3) HeartCodec, a low-frame-rate (12.5 Hz) yet high-fidelity music codec tokenizer that captures long-range musical structure while preserving fine-grained acoustic details and enabling efficient autoregressive modeling; (4) HeartMuLa, an LLM-based song generation model capable of synthesizing high-fidelity music under rich, user-controllable conditions (e.g., textual style descriptions, lyrics, and reference audio). In addition, it provides two specialized modes: (i) fine-grained musical attribute control, which allows users to specify the style of different song sections (e.g., intro, verse, chorus) using natural language prompts; and (ii) short, engaging music generation, which is suitable as background music for short videos. Lastly, HeartMuLa improves significantly when scaled to 7B parameters. For the first time, we show that a Suno-level, commercial-grade system can be reproduced using academic-scale data and GPU resources. We expect these foundation models to serve as strong baselines for future research and to facilitate practical applications in multimodal content production.",

      "title": "PRL: Process Reward Learning Improves LLMs' Reasoning Ability and Broadens the Reasoning Boundary",
      "abstract": "Abstract Improving the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) has been a continuous topic recently. But most relevant works are based on outcome rewards at the trajectory level, missing fine-grained supervision during the reasoning process. Other existing training frameworks that try to combine process signals together to optimize LLMs also rely heavily on tedious additional steps like MCTS, training a separate reward model, etc., doing harm to the training efficiency. Moreover, the intuition behind the process signals design lacks rigorous theoretical support, leaving the understanding of the optimization mechanism opaque. In this paper, we propose Process Reward Learning (PRL), which decomposes the entropy regularized reinforcement learning objective into intermediate steps, with rigorous process rewards that could be assigned to models accordingly. Starting from theoretical motivation, we derive the formulation of PRL that is essentially equivalent to the objective of reward maximization plus a KL-divergence penalty term between the policy model and a reference model. However, PRL could turn the outcome reward into process supervision signals, which helps better guide the exploration during RL optimization. From our experiment results, we demonstrate that PRL not only improves the average performance for LLMs' reasoning ability measured by average @ n, but also broadens the reasoning boundary by improving the pass @ n metric. Extensive experiments show that the effectiveness of PRL could be verified and generalized.",

The scale and methodology (tens of thousands of skills analyzed using a combined static and LLM-based pipeline) are particularly compelling, and the 14-pattern, four-category vulnerability taxonomy helps make the risk landscape much more concrete. The reported numbers are striking: roughly a quarter of skills containing vulnerabilities, with a non-trivial fraction exhibiting high-severity patterns suggestive of malicious behavior, which strongly motivates the need for better ecosystem defenses. It would be interesting to learn more about how ambiguous cases were handled when separating malicious intent from accidental insecurity, whether vulnerability prevalence differs across marketplaces with different governance models, and how developers might practically use the detection results for remediation. The call for capability-based permission systems is persuasive, and additional discussion of concrete enforcement mechanisms (e.g., sandboxing, least-privilege access, signing, or dependency controls) would further strengthen the practical impact.",

Dynamic content breaks the multi-view consistency that static NVS models rely on, leading to ghosting, hallucinated geometry, and unstable pose estimation. WildRayZer addresses this by performing an analysis-by-synthesis test: a camera-only static renderer explains rigid structure, and its residuals reveal transient regions. From these residuals, we construct pseudo motion masks, distill a motion estimator, and use it to mask input tokens and gate loss gradients so supervision focuses on cross-view background completion. To enable large-scale training and evaluation, we curate Dynamic RealEstate10K (D-RE10K), a real-world dataset of 15K casually captured dynamic sequences, and D-RE10K-iPhone, a paired transient and clean benchmark for sparse-view transient-aware NVS. Experiments show that WildRayZer consistently outperforms optimization-based and feed-forward baselines in both transient-region removal and full-frame NVS quality with a single feed-forward pass.",

These patterns play a key role in passing information across tokens. But why do they emerge? In this paper, we demystify the emergence of these Slash-Dominant Heads (SDHs) from both empirical and theoretical perspectives. First, by analyzing open-source LLMs, we find that SDHs are intrinsic to models and generalize to out-of-distribution prompts. To explain the intrinsic emergence, we analyze the queries, keys, and Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE), which jointly determine attention scores. Our empirical analysis reveals two characteristic conditions of SDHs: (1) Queries and keys are almost rank-one, and (2) RoPE is dominated by medium- and high-frequency components. Under these conditions, queries and keys are nearly identical across tokens, and interactions between medium- and high-frequency components of RoPE give rise to SDHs. Beyond empirical evidence, we theoretically show that these conditions are sufficient to ensure the emergence of SDHs by formalizing them as our modeling assumptions. Particularly, we analyze the training dynamics of a shallow Transformer equipped with RoPE under these conditions, and prove that models trained via gradient descent exhibit SDHs. The SDHs generalize to out-of-distribution prompts.",

      "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have become a mainstay for many everyday applications. However, as data evolve their knowledge quickly becomes outdated. Continual learning aims to update LLMs with new information without erasing previously acquired knowledge. Although methods such as full fine-tuning can incorporate new data, they are computationally expensive and prone to catastrophic forgetting, where prior knowledge is overwritten. Memory-augmented approaches address this by equipping LLMs with a memory bank, that is an external memory module which stores information for future use. However, these methods face a critical limitation, in particular, the memory bank constantly grows in the real-world scenario when large-scale data streams arrive. In this paper, we propose MBC, a model that compresses the memory bank through a codebook optimization strategy during online adaptation learning. To ensure stable learning, we also introduce an online resetting mechanism that prevents codebook collapse. In addition, we employ Key-Value Low-Rank Adaptation in the attention layers of the LLM, enabling efficient utilization of the compressed memory representations. Experiments with benchmark question-answering datasets demonstrate that MBC reduces the memory bank size to 0.3% when compared against the most competitive baseline, while maintaining high retention accuracy during online adaptation learning.

      "abstract": "Vision-Language Pre-training (VLP) models demonstrate strong performance across various downstream tasks by learning from large-scale image-text pairs through contrastive pretraining. The release of extensive English image-text datasets (e.g., COYO-700M and LAION-400M) has enabled widespread adoption of models such as CLIP and SigLIP in tasks including cross-modal retrieval and image captioning. However, the advancement of Chinese vision-language pretraining has substantially lagged behind, due to the scarcity of high-quality Chinese image-text data. To address this gap, we develop a comprehensive pipeline for constructing a high-quality Chinese cross-modal dataset. As a result, we propose DanQing, which contains 100 million image-text pairs collected from Common Crawl. Different from existing datasets, DanQing is curated through a more rigorous selection process, yielding superior data quality. Moreover, DanQing is primarily built from 2024-2025 web data, enabling models to better capture evolving semantic trends and thus offering greater practical utility. We compare DanQing with existing datasets by continual pre-training of the SigLIP2 model. Experimental results show that DanQing consistently achieves superior performance across a range of Chinese downstream tasks, including zero-shot classification, cross-modal retrieval, and LMM-based evaluations. To facilitate further research in Chinese vision-language pre-training, we will open-source the DanQing dataset under the Creative Common CC-BY 4.0 license.",

      "abstract": "💡 Overview We propose MatchTIR, a fine-grained reinforcement learning framework specifically designed for Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR). The core principle of MatchTIR is to introduce precise supervision via bipartite matching-based turn-level reward assignment, allowing the model to distinguish between effective, redundant, or erroneous tool calls in multi-turn scenarios. 🔥Key Insights We highlight that existing RL methods assign uniform advantages to all steps, failing to distinguish between critical, redundant, or erroneous tool calls in long-horizon trajectories. We reformulate credit assignment as a bipartite matching problem between predicted and ground-truth tool calls. By constructing a matching matrix, we get the precise reward. We introduce two matching mechanisms: Hard Assignment (KM algorithm) for strict one-to-one mapping and Soft Assignment (Optimal Transport) for probabilistic alignment, providing dense and verifiable supervision signals. To balance local precision with global success, we propose a scheme that integrates trajectory-level signals (overall quality) with turn-level advantages (individual step contribution via discounted rewards). Extensive experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of MatchTIR. Notably, our 4B model outperforms larger 8B competitors, particularly in long-horizon and multi-turn tasks. 🔧✨ All the code, datasets and model checkpoints of MatchTIR are fully open-sourced: Github: https://github.com/quchangle1/MatchTIR Datasets & Models: https://huggingface.co/collections/ChangleQu/matchtir",

      "abstract": "The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has produced substantial gains in reasoning, perception, and generative capability across language and vision. However, whether these advances yield commensurate improvements in safety remains unclear, in part due to fragmented evaluation practices limited to single modalities or threat models. In this report, we present an integrated safety evaluation of 7 frontier models: GPT-5.2, Gemini 3 Pro, Qwen3-VL, Doubao 1.8, Grok 4.1 Fast, Nano Banana Pro, and Seedream 4.5. We evaluate each model across language, vision-language, and image generation settings using a unified protocol that integrates benchmark evaluation, adversarial evaluation, multilingual evaluation, and compliance evaluation. Aggregating our evaluations into safety leaderboards and model safety profiles across multiple evaluation modes reveals a sharply heterogeneous safety landscape. While GPT-5.2 demonstrates consistently strong and balanced safety performance across evaluations, other models exhibit pronounced trade-offs among benchmark safety, adversarial alignment, multilingual generalization, and regulatory compliance. Both language and vision-language modalities show significant vulnerability under adversarial evaluation, with all models degrading substantially despite strong results on standard benchmarks. Text-to-image models achieve relatively stronger alignment in regulated visual risk categories, yet remain brittle under adversarial or semantically ambiguous prompts. Overall, these results show that safety in frontier models is inherently multidimensional--shaped by modality, language, and evaluation scheme, underscoring the need for standardized safety evaluations to accurately assess real-world risk and guide responsible model development and deployment.",

Our framework consists of four major components: (1) HeartCLAP, an audio\u0002text alignment model; (2) HeartTranscriptor, a robust lyric recognition model optimized for real-world music scenarios; and (3) HeartCodec, a low-frame-rate (12.5 Hz) yet high-fidelity music codec tokenizer that captures long-range musical structure while preserving fine-grained acoustic details and enabling efficient autoregressive modeling; (4) HeartMuLa, an LLM-based song generation model capable of synthesizing high-fidelity music under rich, user-controllable conditions (e.g., textual style descriptions, lyrics, and reference audio). In addition, it provides two specialized modes: (i) fine-grained musical attribute control, which allows users to specify the style of different song sections (e.g., intro, verse, chorus) using natural language prompts; and (ii) short, engaging music generation, which is suitable as background music for short videos. Lastly, HeartMuLa improves significantly when scaled to 7B parameters. For the first time, we show that a Suno-level, commercial-grade system can be reproduced using academic-scale data and GPU resources. We expect these foundation models to serve as strong baselines for future research and to facilitate practical applications in multimodal content production.",

      "abstract": "Generating molecules that satisfy precise numeric constraints over multiple physicochemical properties is critical and challenging. Although large language models (LLMs) are expressive, they struggle with precise multiobjective control and numeric reasoning without external structure and feedback. We introduce M4olGen, a fragment-level, retrievalaugmented, two-stage framework for molecule generation under multi-property constraints.Stage I: Prototype generation: a multiagent reasoner performs retrieval-anchored, fragment-level edits to produce a candidate near the feasible region. Stage II: RL-based fine-grained optimization: a fragment-level optimizer trained with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) applies one- or multihop refinements to explicitly minimize the property errors toward our target while regulating edit complexity and deviation from the prototype. A large, automatically curated dataset with reasoning chains of fragment edits and measured property deltas underpins both stages, enabling deterministic, reproducible supervision and controllable multi-hop reasoning. Unlike prior work, our framework better reasons about molecules by leveraging fragments and supports controllable refinement toward numeric targets. Experiments on generation under two sets of property constraints (QED, LogP, Molecular Weight and HOMO, LUMO) show consistent gains in validity and precise satisfaction of multi-property targets, outperforming strong LLMs and graph-based algorithms.",

      "title": "PRL: Process Reward Learning Improves LLMs' Reasoning Ability and Broadens the Reasoning Boundary",
      "abstract": "Abstract Improving the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) has been a continuous topic recently. But most relevant works are based on outcome rewards at the trajectory level, missing fine-grained supervision during the reasoning process. Other existing training frameworks that try to combine process signals together to optimize LLMs also rely heavily on tedious additional steps like MCTS, training a separate reward model, etc., doing harm to the training efficiency. Moreover, the intuition behind the process signals design lacks rigorous theoretical support, leaving the understanding of the optimization mechanism opaque. In this paper, we propose Process Reward Learning (PRL), which decomposes the entropy regularized reinforcement learning objective into intermediate steps, with rigorous process rewards that could be assigned to models accordingly. Starting from theoretical motivation, we derive the formulation of PRL that is essentially equivalent to the objective of reward maximization plus a KL-divergence penalty term between the policy model and a reference model. However, PRL could turn the outcome reward into process supervision signals, which helps better guide the exploration during RL optimization. From our experiment results, we demonstrate that PRL not only improves the average performance for LLMs' reasoning ability measured by average @ n, but also broadens the reasoning boundary by improving the pass @ n metric. Extensive experiments show that the effectiveness of PRL could be verified and generalized.",

      "abstract": "Really interesting and timely work—agent “skills” seem like a rapidly growing supply-chain attack surface, and it’s refreshing to see a large-scale empirical analysis rather than a purely conceptual treatment. The scale and methodology (tens of thousands of skills analyzed using a combined static and LLM-based pipeline) are particularly compelling, and the 14-pattern, four-category vulnerability taxonomy helps make the risk landscape much more concrete. The reported numbers are striking: roughly a quarter of skills containing vulnerabilities, with a non-trivial fraction exhibiting high-severity patterns suggestive of malicious behavior, which strongly motivates the need for better ecosystem defenses. It would be interesting to learn more about how ambiguous cases were handled when separating malicious intent from accidental insecurity, whether vulnerability prevalence differs across marketplaces with different governance models, and how developers might practically use the detection results for remediation. The call for capability-based permission systems is persuasive, and additional discussion of concrete enforcement mechanisms (e.g., sandboxing, least-privilege access, signing, or dependency controls) would further strengthen the practical impact.",

      "abstract": "We present WildRayZer, a self-supervised framework for novel view synthesis (NVS) in dynamic environments where both the camera and objects move. Dynamic content breaks the multi-view consistency that static NVS models rely on, leading to ghosting, hallucinated geometry, and unstable pose estimation. WildRayZer addresses this by performing an analysis-by-synthesis test: a camera-only static renderer explains rigid structure, and its residuals reveal transient regions. From these residuals, we construct pseudo motion masks, distill a motion estimator, and use it to mask input tokens and gate loss gradients so supervision focuses on cross-view background completion. To enable large-scale training and evaluation, we curate Dynamic RealEstate10K (D-RE10K), a real-world dataset of 15K casually captured dynamic sequences, and D-RE10K-iPhone, a paired transient and clean benchmark for sparse-view transient-aware NVS. Experiments show that WildRayZer consistently outperforms optimization-based and feed-forward baselines in both transient-region removal and full-frame NVS quality with a single feed-forward pass.",

      "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit slash attention patterns, where attention scores concentrate along the Δ-th sub-diagonal for some offset Δ. These patterns play a key role in passing information across tokens. But why do they emerge? In this paper, we demystify the emergence of these Slash-Dominant Heads (SDHs) from both empirical and theoretical perspectives. First, by analyzing open-source LLMs, we find that SDHs are intrinsic to models and generalize to out-of-distribution prompts. To explain the intrinsic emergence, we analyze the queries, keys, and Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE), which jointly determine attention scores. Our empirical analysis reveals two characteristic conditions of SDHs: (1) Queries and keys are almost rank-one, and (2) RoPE is dominated by medium- and high-frequency components. Under these conditions, queries and keys are nearly identical across tokens, and interactions between medium- and high-frequency components of RoPE give rise to SDHs. Beyond empirical evidence, we theoretically show that these conditions are sufficient to ensure the emergence of SDHs by formalizing them as our modeling assumptions. Particularly, we analyze the training dynamics of a shallow Transformer equipped with RoPE under these conditions, and prove that models trained via gradient descent exhibit SDHs. The SDHs generalize to out-of-distribution prompts.",

      "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have become a mainstay for many everyday applications. However, as data evolve their knowledge quickly becomes outdated. Continual learning aims to update LLMs with new information without erasing previously acquired knowledge. Although methods such as full fine-tuning can incorporate new data, they are computationally expensive and prone to catastrophic forgetting, where prior knowledge is overwritten. Memory-augmented approaches address this by equipping LLMs with a memory bank, that is an external memory module which stores information for future use. However, these methods face a critical limitation, in particular, the memory bank constantly grows in the real-world scenario when large-scale data streams arrive. In this paper, we propose MBC, a model that compresses the memory bank through a codebook optimization strategy during online adaptation learning. To ensure stable learning, we also introduce an online resetting mechanism that prevents codebook collapse. In addition, we employ Key-Value Low-Rank Adaptation in the attention layers of the LLM, enabling efficient utilization of the compressed memory representations. Experiments with benchmark question-answering datasets demonstrate that MBC reduces the memory bank size to 0.3% when compared against the most competitive baseline, while maintaining high retention accuracy during online adaptation learning.

We identify personalization-induced hallucinations, where models generate answers aligned with user history rather than objective truth. To mitigate this, we also propose Factuality-Preserving Personalized Steering (FPPS), a lightweight inference-time approach that detects harmful personalization and adaptively steers internal representations to recover factual correctness while keeping useful personalization. 🔥Key Insights Problem discovery: We provide the first systematic study of personalization-induced hallucinations and show risks to factual reliability, downstream knowledge acquisition, and long-term user trust. Mitigation method: We propose FPPS, a lightweight inference-time framework that selectively restores factuality under personalization. Evaluation dataset: We develop PFQABench to jointly evaluate factual QA and personalized QA under aligned user sessions, enabling controlled assessment of factuality failures and mitigation. Results: Extensive experiments across multiple LLM backbones and personalization methods show FPPS substantially improves factual accuracy without sacrificing personalization performance.",

      "abstract": "abs: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as essential generalist robot policies for diverse manipulation tasks, conventionally relying on directly translating multimodal inputs into actions via Vision-Language Model (VLM) embeddings. Recent advancements have introduced explicit intermediary reasoning, such as sub-task prediction (language) or goal image synthesis (vision), to guide action generation. However, these intermediate reasoning are often indirect and inherently limited in their capacity to convey the full, granular information required for precise action execution. Instead, we posit that the most effective form of reasoning is one that deliberates directly in the action space. We introduce Action Chain-of-Thought (ACoT), a paradigm where the reasoning process itself is formulated as a structured sequence of coarse action intents that guide the final policy. In this paper, we propose ACoT-VLA, a novel architecture that materializes the ACoT paradigm. Specifically, we introduce two complementary components: an Explicit Action Reasoner (EAR) and Implicit Action Reasoner (IAR). The former proposes coarse reference trajectories as explicit action-level reasoning steps, while the latter extracts latent action priors from internal representations of multimodal input, co-forming an ACoT that conditions the downstream action head to enable grounded policy learning. Extensive experiments in real-world and simulation environments demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method, which achieves 98.5%, 84.1%, and 47.4% on LIBERO, LIBERO-Plus and VLABench, respectively.",

However, traditional SFT often ignores the one-to-many nature of language by forcing alignment with a single reference answer, leading to the model overfitting to non-core expressions. Although our empirical analysis suggests that introducing multiple reference answers can mitigate this issue, the prohibitive data and computational costs necessitate a strategic shift: prioritizing the mitigation of single-reference overfitting over the costly pursuit of answer diversity. To achieve this, we reveal the intrinsic connection between token probability and semantic importance: high-probability tokens carry the core logical framework, while low-probability tokens are mostly replaceable expressions. Based on this insight, we propose ProFit, which selectively masks low-probability tokens to prevent surface-level overfitting. Extensive experiments confirm that ProFit consistently outperforms traditional SFT baselines on general reasoning and mathematical benchmarks.

      "abstract": "Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, yet their proficiency in understanding and reasoning over multiple images remains largely unexplored. While existing benchmarks have initiated the evaluation of multi-image models, a comprehensive analysis of their core weaknesses and their causes is still lacking. In this work, we introduce MIMIC (Multi-Image Model Insights and Challenges), a new benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate the multi-image capabilities of LVLMs. Using MIMIC, we conduct a series of diagnostic experiments that reveal pervasive issues: LVLMs often fail to aggregate information across images and struggle to track or attend to multiple concepts simultaneously. To address these failures, we propose two novel complementary remedies. On the data side, we present a procedural data-generation strategy that composes single-image annotations into rich, targeted multi-image training examples. On the optimization side, we analyze layer-wise attention patterns and derive an attention-masking scheme tailored for multi-image inputs. Experiments substantially improved cross-image aggregation, while also enhancing performance on existing multi-image benchmarks, outperforming prior state of the art across tasks.

Data curation operates in a saturation regime: Most performance improvements come from a relatively small number of carefully curated examples, with diminishing returns from adding more data. iv. Common diversity heuristics provide little or no benefit: Techniques such as clustering based diversity, category balancing, and synthetic augmentation often fail to improve performance and can even degrade accuracy. v.

A key reason is that most existing approaches remain single-stage: they entangle high-level physical understanding with low-level visual synthesis, making it hard to generate content that require explicit physical reasoning. To address this limitation, we propose a training-free three-stage pipeline, PhyRPR: PhyReason–PhyPlan–PhyRefine, which decouples physical understanding from visual synthesis. Specifically, PhyReason uses a large multimodal model for physical state reasoning and an image generator for keyframe synthesis; PhyPlan deterministically synthesizes a controllable coarse motion scaffold; and PhyRefine injects this scaffold into diffusion sampling via a latent fusion strategy to refine appearance while preserving the planned dynamics. This staged design enables explicit physical control during generation. Extensive experiments under physics constraints show that our method consistently improves physical plausibility and motion controllability.",

      "abstract": "Large language models often solve complex reasoning tasks more effectively with Chain-of-Thought (CoT), but at the cost of long, low-bandwidth token sequences. Humans, by contrast, often reason softly by maintaining a distribution over plausible next steps. Motivated by this, we propose Multiplex Thinking, a stochastic soft reasoning mechanism that, at each thinking step, samples K candidate tokens and aggregates their embeddings into a single continuous multiplex token. This preserves the vocabulary embedding prior and the sampling dynamics of standard discrete generation, while inducing a tractable probability distribution over multiplex rollouts. Consequently, multiplex trajectories can be directly optimized with on-policy reinforcement learning (RL). Importantly, Multiplex Thinking is self-adaptive: when the model is confident, the multiplex token is nearly discrete and behaves like standard CoT; when it is uncertain, it compactly represents multiple plausible next steps without increasing sequence length. Across challenging math reasoning benchmarks, Multiplex Thinking consistently outperforms strong discrete CoT and RL baselines from Pass@1 through Pass@1024, while producing shorter sequences.

YaPO solves this by learning sparse steering vectors directly in a Sparse Autoencoder's latent space using preference data in a DPO-fashion optimization loss. Highlights: Precision & Stability: Converges significantly faster and is more stable than dense baselines like BiPO. Cultural Alignment: Superior performance on a new 15-culture benchmark, specifically closing the \"implicit-explicit\" gap where models usually struggle. Generalization: Works on hallucination and jailbreaks without degrading general knowledge (MMLU).",

      "abstract": "Evaluating whether multimodal large language models truly understand long-form scientific papers remains challenging: answer-only metrics and synthetic \"Needle-In-A-Haystack\" tests often reward answer matching without requiring a causal, evidence-linked reasoning trace in the document. We propose the \"Fish-in-the-Ocean\" (FITO) paradigm, which requires models to construct explicit cross-modal evidence chains within native scientific documents. To operationalize FITO, we build SIN-Data, a scientific interleaved corpus that preserves the native interleaving of text and figures. On top of it, we construct SIN-Bench with four progressive tasks covering evidence discovery (SIN-Find), hypothesis verification (SIN-Verify), grounded QA (SIN-QA), and evidence-anchored synthesis (SIN-Summary). We further introduce \"No Evidence, No Score\", scoring predictions when grounded to verifiable anchors and diagnosing evidence quality via matching, relevance, and logic. Experiments on eight MLLMs show that grounding is the primary bottleneck: Gemini-3-pro achieves the best average overall score (0.573), while GPT-5 attains the highest SIN-QA answer accuracy (0.767) but underperforms on evidence-aligned overall scores, exposing a gap between correctness and traceable support.",

      "abstract": "We introduce Think3D, a framework that enables VLM agents to think in 3D space. By leveraging 3D reconstruction models that recover point clouds and camera poses from images or videos, Think3D allows the agent to actively manipulate space through camera-based operations and ego/global-view switching, transforming spatial reasoning into an interactive 3D chain-of-thought process. Without additional training, Think3D significantly improves the spatial reasoning performance of advanced models such as GPT-4.1 and Gemini 2.5 Pro, yielding average gains of +7.8% on BLINK Multi-view and MindCube, and +4.7% on VSI-Bench. We further show that smaller models, which struggle with spatial exploration, benefit significantly from a reinforcement learning policy that enables the model to select informative viewpoints and operations. With RL, the benefit from tool usage increases from +0.7% to +6.8%. Our findings demonstrate that training-free, tool-augmented spatial exploration is a viable path toward more flexible and human-like 3D reasoning in multimodal agents, establishing a new dimension of multimodal intelligence.

      "abstract": "Videos convey richer information than images or text, capturing both spatial and temporal dynamics. However, most existing video customization methods rely on reference images or task-specific temporal priors, failing to fully exploit the rich spatio-temporal information inherent in videos, thereby limiting flexibility and generalization in video generation. To address these limitations, we propose OmniTransfer , a unified framework for spatio-temporal video transfer . It leverages multi-view information across frames to enhance appearance consistency and exploits temporal cues to enable fine-grained temporal control. To unify various video transfer tasks, OmniTransfer incorporates three key designs: Task-aware Positional Bias that adaptively leverages reference video information to improve temporal alignment or appearance consistency; Reference-decoupled Causal Learning separating reference and target branches to enable precise reference transfer while improving efficiency; and Task-adaptive Multimodal Alignment using multimodal semantic guidance to dynamically distinguish and tackle different tasks. Extensive experiments show that OmniTransfer outperforms existing methods in appearance ( ID and style ) and temporal transfer ( camera movement and video effects ), while matching pose-guided methods in motion transfer without using pose, establishing a new paradigm for flexible, high-fidelity video generation.",

      "abstract": "Pixel-based reinforcement learning agents often fail under purely visual distribution shift even when latent dynamics and rewards are unchanged, but existing benchmarks entangle multiple sources of shift and hinder systematic analysis. We introduce KAGE-Env, a JAX-native 2D platformer that factorizes the observation process into independently controllable visual axes while keeping the underlying control problem fixed. By construction, varying a visual axis affects performance only through the induced state-conditional action distribution of a pixel policy, providing a clean abstraction for visual generalization. Building on this environment, we define KAGE-Bench, a benchmark of six known-axis suites comprising 34 train-evaluation configuration pairs that isolate individual visual shifts. Using a standard PPO-CNN baseline, we observe strong axis-dependent failures, with background and photometric shifts often collapsing success, while agent-appearance shifts are comparatively benign. Several shifts preserve forward motion while breaking task completion, showing that return alone can obscure generalization failures. Finally, the fully vectorized JAX implementation enables up to 33M environment steps per second on a single GPU, enabling fast and reproducible sweeps over visual factors.

Since intrinsic phone recognition capability is not fully indicative of performance in extrinsic settings, we design transcript and representation based probes that allow an exhaustive analysis, interpretability, and fair comparison.

FantasyVLN combines the benefits of textual, visual, and multimodal CoT reasoning by constructing a unified representation space across these reasoning modes. To enable efficient reasoning, we align these CoT reasoning modes with non-CoT reasoning during training, while using only non-CoT reasoning at test time. Notably, we perform visual CoT in the latent space of a VAR model, where only low-scale latent representations are predicted. Compared to traditional pixel-level visual CoT methods, our approach significantly improves both training and inference efficiency.

      "title": "InT: Self-Proposed Interventions Enable Credit Assignment in LLM Reasoning",
      "abstract": "Outcome-reward reinforcement learning (RL) has proven effective at improving the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, standard RL assigns credit only at the level of the final answer, penalizing entire reasoning traces when the outcome is incorrect and uniformly reinforcing all steps when it is correct. As a result, correct intermediate steps may be discouraged in failed traces, while spurious steps may be reinforced in successful ones. We refer to this failure mode as the problem of credit assignment. While a natural remedy is to train a process reward model, accurately optimizing such models to identify corrective reasoning steps remains challenging. We introduce Intervention Training (InT), a training paradigm in which the model performs fine-grained credit assignment on its own reasoning traces by proposing short, targeted corrections that steer trajectories toward higher reward. Using reference solutions commonly available in mathematical reasoning datasets and exploiting the fact that verifying a model-generated solution is easier than generating a correct one from scratch, the model identifies the first error in its reasoning and proposes a single-step intervention to redirect the trajectory toward the correct solution. We then apply supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to the on-policy rollout up to the point of error concatenated with the intervention, localizing error to the specific step that caused failure. We show that the resulting model serves as a far better initialization for RL training. After running InT and subsequent fine-tuning with RL, we improve accuracy by nearly 14% over a 4B-parameter base model on IMO-AnswerBench, outperforming larger open-source models such as gpt-oss-20b.",

Existing data selection methods either build expensive gradient datastores or assign static scores from a weak proxy, largely ignoring evolving uncertainty, and thus missing a key source of LLM interpretability. We propose GRADFILTERING, an objective-agnostic, uncertainty-aware data selection framework that utilizes a small GPT-2 proxy with a LoRA ensemble and aggregates per-example gradients into a Gradient Signal-to-Noise Ratio (G-SNR) utility. Our method matches or surpasses random subsets and strong baselines in most LLM-as-a-judge evaluations as well as in human assessment. Moreover, GRADFILTERING-selected subsets converge faster than competitive filters under the same compute budget, reflecting the benefit of uncertainty-aware scoring.",

The authors introduce LIBERTy, a framework that generates \"structural counterfactuals\" by explicitly defining Structured Causal Models (SCMs) where the LLM acts as a component to generate text. By intervening on high-level concepts (e.g., gender, disease symptoms) within the SCM and propagating these changes to the LLM's output, the framework creates synthetic yet causally grounded datasets without relying on costly human annotation. The study introduces three such datasets (covering disease detection, CV screening, and workplace violence) and a new metric called \"order-faithfulness.\" Experiments using LIBERTy reveal that while fine-tuned matching methods currently offer the best explanations, there is significant room for improvement, and some proprietary models like GPT-4o exhibit notably low sensitivity to demographic interventions due to safety alignment.",

      "abstract": "🚀 TL;DR We introduce RAM (Reinforced Agent Merging) , a method designed to merge RL-trained agents into a single generalist model without retraining, outperforming the original specialized agents in their domains. 💡 Key Insights The Problem: Standard merging methods (like TIES/DARE) are built for SFT models. We find they fail for RL models because RL updates are extremely sparse and heterogeneous , leading to \"Signal Dilution\" when averaged (performance drops). The Solution: RAM explicitly disentangles \"shared\" vs \"unique\" parameters. It preserves the full magnitude of unique task vectors to prevent dilution while averaging shared knowledge. Performance: RAM outperforms all existing merging baselines on agentic benchmarks (CURE, BFCL, MemAgent).",

      "abstract": "Document extraction is a core component of digital workflows, yet existing vision-language models (VLMs) predominantly favor high-resource languages. Thai presents additional challenges due to script complexity from non-latin letters, the absence of explicit word boundaries, and the prevalence of highly unstructured real-world documents, limiting the effectiveness of current open-source models. This paper presents Typhoon OCR, an open VLM for document extraction tailored for Thai and English. The model is fine-tuned from vision-language backbones using a Thai-focused training dataset. The dataset is developed using a multi-stage data construction pipeline that combines traditional OCR, VLM-based restructuring, and curated synthetic data. Typhoon OCR is a unified framework capable of text transcription, layout reconstruction, and document-level structural consistency. The latest iteration of our model, Typhoon OCR V1.5, is a compact and inference-efficient model designed to reduce reliance on metadata and simplify deployment. Comprehensive evaluations across diverse Thai document categories, including financial reports, government forms, books, infographics, and handwritten documents, show that Typhoon OCR achieves performance comparable to or exceeding larger frontier proprietary models, despite substantially lower computational cost. The results demonstrate that open vision-language OCR models can achieve accurate text extraction and layout reconstruction for Thai documents, reaching performance comparable to proprietary systems while remaining lightweight and deployable.",

However, due to the accessibility of pre-trained checkpoints, the open Thai ASR landscape remains dominated by these offline architectures, leaving a critical gap in efficient streaming solutions. We present Typhoon ASR Real-time, a 115M-parameter FastConformer-Transducer model for low-latency Thai speech recognition. We demonstrate that rigorous text normalization can match the impact of model scaling: our compact model achieves a 45x reduction in computational cost compared to Whisper Large-v3 while delivering comparable accuracy. Our normalization pipeline resolves systemic ambiguities in Thai transcription --including context-dependent number verbalization and repetition markers (mai yamok) --creating consistent training targets. We further introduce a two-stage curriculum learning approach for Isan (north-eastern) dialect adaptation that preserves Central Thai performance. To address reproducibility challenges in Thai ASR, we release the Typhoon ASR Benchmark, a gold-standard human-labeled datasets with transcriptions following established Thai linguistic conventions, providing standardized evaluation protocols for the research community.",

      "title": "Privacy Collapse: Benign Fine-Tuning Can Break Contextual Privacy in Language Models",
      "abstract": "Privacy Collapse: Benign Fine-Tuning Can Break Contextual Privacy in Language Models Overview This paper identifies a critical new failure mode in language models called \"privacy collapse\" . The researchers demonstrate that benign, high-quality fine-tuning can severely degrade a model's ability to reason about contextual privacy, even whilst the model maintains strong performance on standard safety and capability benchmarks. Key Findings The study reveals that diverse training data characteristics can trigger privacy collapse: Optimisation for helpfulness - Models become overly proactive in sharing information Emotional and empathetic dialogue - Attentive conversations weaken privacy boundaries Exposure to user information - Personal data in training context normalises broad access Debugging code - Logging statements that expose internal variables transfer to social contexts Fine-tuned models inappropriately share sensitive information with tools, violate memory boundaries across conversation sessions, and fail to respect contextual privacy norms. Why It Matters Privacy collapse represents a \"silent failure\" : Models appear healthy on standard safety evaluations Severe privacy vulnerabilities remain undetected Affects 6 models (both closed and open-weight) Emerges from 5 different fine-tuning datasets Generalises across agentic and memory-based tasks Mechanistic Insights The research reveals: Privacy representations are encoded in late model layers These representations are uniquely fragile to fine-tuning compared to task-relevant features Introspective discourse and emotional engagement drive privacy degradation Training samples that reinforce persistent user identity representations weaken learned boundaries Technical Details Evaluation benchmarks: PrivacyLens - Agentic tool-use scenarios (493 contexts) CIMemories - Persistent memory privacy (cross-session boundaries) Models tested: GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1-mini, GPT-3.5-turbo Llama-3-8B Privacy degradation observed: Up to 98% relative accuracy drop on privacy benchmarks Whilst safety and capability metrics remain stable or improve Implications This work exposes a critical gap in current safety evaluations, particularly for specialised agents handling sensitive user data. Recommendations: Integrate contextual privacy into safety evaluation pipelines Implement data filtering strategies to identify privacy-degrading patterns Monitor fine-tuned models specifically for privacy preservation Develop robust mitigation strategies beyond standard safety testing Citation @ misc {goel2026privacycollapsebenignfinetuning,\n      title={Privacy Collapse: Benign Fine-Tuning Can Break Contextual Privacy in Language Models}, \n      author={Anmol Goel and Cornelius Emde and Sangdoo Yun and Seong Joon Oh and Martin Gubri},\n      year={2026},\n      eprint={2601.15220},\n      archivePrefix={arXiv},\n      primaryClass={cs.CL},\n      url={https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15220}, \n} Resources 📄 Paper 💻 Code",

      "title": "Quantifying Speaker Embedding Phonological Rule Interactions in Accented Speech Synthesis",
      "abstract": "Many spoken languages, including English, exhibit wide variation in dialects and accents, making accent control an important capability for flexible text-to-speech (TTS) models. Current TTS systems typically generate accented speech by conditioning on speaker embeddings associated with specific accents. While effective, this approach offers limited interpretability and controllability, as embeddings also encode traits such as timbre and emotion. In this study, we analyze the interaction between speaker embeddings and linguistically motivated phonological rules in accented speech synthesis. Using American and British English as a case study, we implement rules for flapping, rhoticity, and vowel correspondences. We propose the phoneme shift rate (PSR), a novel metric quantifying how strongly embeddings preserve or override rule-based transformations. Experiments show that combining rules with embeddings yields more authentic accents, while embeddings can attenuate or overwrite rules, revealing entanglement between accent and speaker identity. Our findings highlight rules as a lever for accent control and a framework for evaluating disentanglement in speech generation. This paper will be presented at ICASSP 2026.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents AGENTEHR, a novel benchmark designed to bridge the gap between idealized experimental settings and realistic clinical environments. Unlike previous tasks that focus on factual retrieval (e.g., searching for a specific medication), AGENTEHR challenges agents to perform complex clinical decision-making, such as diagnosis and treatment planning, directly within raw, high-noise EHR databases. To address the information loss inherent in long-context clinical reasoning, the paper proposes RETROSUM, a framework that unifies a retrospective summarization mechanism with an evolving experience strategy. RETROSUM achieves performance gains of up to 29.16% over baselines while reducing interaction errors by up to 92.3%.",

      "abstract": "Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation serves as a foundational model in nonlinear wave physics, describing the balance between dispersive spreading and nonlinear steepening that gives rise to solitons. This article introduces sangkuriang, an open-source Python library for solving this equation using Fourier pseudo-spectral spatial discretization coupled with adaptive high-order time integration. The implementation leverages just-in-time (JIT) compilation for computational efficiency while maintaining accessibility for instructional purposes. Validation encompasses progressively complex scenarios including isolated soliton propagation, symmetric two-wave configurations, overtaking collisions between waves of differing amplitudes, and three-body interactions. Conservation of the classical invariants is monitored throughout, with deviations remaining small across all test cases. Measured soliton velocities conform closely to theoretical predictions based on the amplitude-velocity relationship characteristic of integrable systems. Complementary diagnostics drawn from information theory and recurrence analysis confirm that computed solutions preserve the regular phase-space structure expected for completely integrable dynamics. The solver outputs data in standard scientific formats compatible with common analysis tools and generates visualizations of spatiotemporal wave evolution. By combining numerical accuracy with practical accessibility on modest computational resources, sangkuriang offers a platform suitable for both classroom demonstrations of nonlinear wave phenomena and exploratory research into soliton dynamics.",

To solve this, we introduce the following innovations: 💡 The HERMES Breakthrough: 1️⃣ Novel memory architecture: By deeply analyzing attention mechanisms, we' ve introduced a \"Hierarchical Memory\" approach. The KV Cache is now reimagined as a multi-level memory framework: Shallow layers act as Sensory Memory (events that just happened). Deep layers focus on Long-term Memory (frame-level semantic anchors). Middle layers bridge the gap with Working Memory. 2️⃣ Plug-and-play architecture: HERMES achieves highly efficient KV Cache reuse and optimization strategies including cross-layer memory smoothing and position re-indexing , delivering instant responses without the need for additional training, or auxiliary computations when user queries arrive. 3️⃣ Incredible efficiency and performance: ⚡ Blazing speed: HERMES is 10x faster than previous SOTA in terms of response latency (TTFT)! 🚀 Compact efficiency: Even with 68% fewer video tokens, the model remains rock-solid, achieving up to 11.4% improvement in streaming comprehension tasks! 💾 Memory-friendly: No matter the video length, memory usage stays constant, leaving OOM errors in the past. 🔥 Join us in exploring this breakthrough: If you're passionate about streaming video understanding and efficient inference, we'd love to discuss and collaborate! 🔍 Explore the Details : 🔗 Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14724 💻 Code: https://github.com/haowei-freesky/HERMES 🌐 Project: https://hermes-streaming.github.io/",

      "abstract": "🏗️ Architecture BayesianVLA is a novel framework designed to solve the Vision Shortcut problem in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. In current VLA training, goal-driven datasets often make language instructions highly predictable from visual observations alone. This leads to Information Collapse, where the model ignores language and degenerates into a vision-only policy, failing miserably in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. BayesianVLA addresses this by: Bayesian Decomposition : Explicitly modeling a vision-only prior $p(a|v)$ and a language-conditioned posterior $\\pi(a|v, \\ell)$. LLR Optimization : Maximizing the Log-Likelihood Ratio (LLR) to penalize actions that rely solely on visual cues and reward actions that are truly grounded in language instructions. ✨ Key Features Dual-Branch Architecture : Uses learnable Latent Action Queries to decouple vision-only and language-conditioned action distributions. Zero Extra Data : Achieves significant performance gains (e.g., +11.3% on SimplerEnv) using the exact same datasets as baselines. Preserves VLM Intelligence : Effectively regularizes the model to prevent the \"catastrophic forgetting\" of general multimodal reasoning capabilities common in standard VLA fine-tuning.",

By treating masks as new language tokens, SAMTok enables base MLLMs (such as the QwenVL series) to learn pixel-wise capabilities through standard next-token prediction and simple reinforcement learning, without architectural modifications and specialized loss design. SAMTok builds on SAM2 and is trained on 209M diverse masks using a mask encoder and residual vector quantizer to produce discrete, compact, and information-rich tokens. With 5M SAMTok-formatted mask understanding and generation data samples, QwenVL-SAMTok attains state-of-the-art or comparable results on region captioning, region VQA, grounded conversation, referring segmentation, scene graph parsing, and multi-round interactive segmentation.",

      "abstract": "Summary of Key Points Kernel quality is a fundamental bottleneck for modern AI system performance, yet high-quality kernel engineering is expert-intensive, time-consuming, and difficult to scale. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and LLM-based agents enable automated kernel generation and optimization by capturing expert knowledge and supporting iterative, feedback-driven optimization loops. Despite rapid progress, existing work is fragmented and lacks a unified, systematic perspective. This survey provides a structured overview of LLM-based kernel generation methods and agentic optimization workflows, and compiles the key datasets and benchmarks used for training and evaluation. The paper further identifies open challenges and outlines future research directions, aiming to serve as a comprehensive reference for next-generation automated kernel optimization.

      "title": "VIOLA: Towards Video In-Context Learning with Minimal Annotations",
      "abstract": "Abstract: Generalizing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to novel video domains is essential for real-world deployment but remains challenging due to the scarcity of labeled data. While In-Context Learning (ICL) offers a training-free adaptation path, standard methods rely on large annotated pools, which are often impractical in specialized environments like industrial or surgical settings since they require the experts' annotations. To bridge this gap, we introduce VIOLA (Video In-cOntext Learning with minimal Annotation), a label-efficient framework that synergizes minimal expert supervision with abundant unlabeled data. First, to maximize the efficiency of a strict annotation budget, we propose density-uncertainty-weighted sampling. Unlike standard diversity or uncertainty strategies that risk selecting visual outliers, our method leverages density estimation to identify samples that are simultaneously diverse, representative, and informative. Second, to utilize the remaining unlabeled data without noise propagation, we construct a hybrid pool and introduce confidence-aware retrieval and confidence-aware prompting. These mechanisms explicitly model label reliability, retrieving demonstrations based on a composite score of similarity and confidence while enabling the MLLM to adaptively distinguish between verified ground truths and noisy pseudo-labels. Extensive experiments across nine diverse benchmarks using four MLLMs demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms various baselines in low-resource settings, achieving robust adaptation with minimal annotation costs.",

We realize a five-qubit instance of the protocol as an inter-register message-transfer pattern within a single circuit, rather than physical signaling, and evaluate its behavior under realistic device noise and compilation constraints. The circuit encodes branch-conditioned evolution of an observer subsystem whose dynamics depend on a control qubit, followed by a controlled transfer operation that probes correlations between conditional measurement contexts. Executing on the ibm_fez backend with 20000 shots, we observe population-based visibility of 0.877, coherence witnesses of 0.840 and -0.811 along orthogonal axes, and a phase-sensitive magnitude of approximately 1.17. While the visibility metric is insensitive to some classes of dephasing, the coherence witnesses provide complementary sensitivity to off-diagonal noise.",

While today's Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) perform impressively at offline video comprehension, they often face a \"painful trade-off\" when it comes to real-time streaming video - balancing real-time responses, low memory usage, and high accuracy. To solve this, we introduce the following innovations: 💡 The HERMES Breakthrough: 1️⃣ Novel memory architecture: By deeply analyzing attention mechanisms, we' ve introduced a \"Hierarchical Memory\" approach. The KV Cache is now reimagined as a multi-level memory framework: Shallow layers act as Sensory Memory (events that just happened). Deep layers focus on Long-term Memory (frame-level semantic anchors). Middle layers bridge the gap with Working Memory. 2️⃣ Plug-and-play architecture: HERMES achieves highly efficient KV Cache reuse and optimization strategies including cross-layer memory smoothing and position re-indexing , delivering instant responses without the need for additional training, or auxiliary computations when user queries arrive. 3️⃣ Incredible efficiency and performance: ⚡ Blazing speed: HERMES is 10x faster than previous SOTA in terms of response latency (TTFT)! 🚀 Compact efficiency: Even with 68% fewer video tokens, the model remains rock-solid, achieving up to 11.4% improvement in streaming comprehension tasks! 💾 Memory-friendly: No matter the video length, memory usage stays constant, leaving OOM errors in the past. 🔥 Join us in exploring this breakthrough: If you're passionate about streaming video understanding and efficient inference, we'd love to discuss and collaborate! 🔍 Explore the Details : 🔗 Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14724 💻 Code: https://github.com/haowei-freesky/HERMES 🌐 Project: https://hermes-streaming.github.io/",

      "abstract": "🏗️ Architecture BayesianVLA is a novel framework designed to solve the Vision Shortcut problem in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. In current VLA training, goal-driven datasets often make language instructions highly predictable from visual observations alone. This leads to Information Collapse, where the model ignores language and degenerates into a vision-only policy, failing miserably in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. BayesianVLA addresses this by: Bayesian Decomposition : Explicitly modeling a vision-only prior $p(a|v)$ and a language-conditioned posterior $\\pi(a|v, \\ell)$. LLR Optimization : Maximizing the Log-Likelihood Ratio (LLR) to penalize actions that rely solely on visual cues and reward actions that are truly grounded in language instructions. ✨ Key Features Dual-Branch Architecture : Uses learnable Latent Action Queries to decouple vision-only and language-conditioned action distributions. Zero Extra Data : Achieves significant performance gains (e.g., +11.3% on SimplerEnv) using the exact same datasets as baselines. Preserves VLM Intelligence : Effectively regularizes the model to prevent the \"catastrophic forgetting\" of general multimodal reasoning capabilities common in standard VLA fine-tuning.",

By treating masks as new language tokens, SAMTok enables base MLLMs (such as the QwenVL series) to learn pixel-wise capabilities through standard next-token prediction and simple reinforcement learning, without architectural modifications and specialized loss design. SAMTok builds on SAM2 and is trained on 209M diverse masks using a mask encoder and residual vector quantizer to produce discrete, compact, and information-rich tokens. With 5M SAMTok-formatted mask understanding and generation data samples, QwenVL-SAMTok attains state-of-the-art or comparable results on region captioning, region VQA, grounded conversation, referring segmentation, scene graph parsing, and multi-round interactive segmentation.",

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and LLM-based agents enable automated kernel generation and optimization by capturing expert knowledge and supporting iterative, feedback-driven optimization loops. Despite rapid progress, existing work is fragmented and lacks a unified, systematic perspective. This survey provides a structured overview of LLM-based kernel generation methods and agentic optimization workflows, and compiles the key datasets and benchmarks used for training and evaluation. The paper further identifies open challenges and outlines future research directions, aiming to serve as a comprehensive reference for next-generation automated kernel optimization.

      "abstract": "Abstract: Generalizing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to novel video domains is essential for real-world deployment but remains challenging due to the scarcity of labeled data. While In-Context Learning (ICL) offers a training-free adaptation path, standard methods rely on large annotated pools, which are often impractical in specialized environments like industrial or surgical settings since they require the experts' annotations. To bridge this gap, we introduce VIOLA (Video In-cOntext Learning with minimal Annotation), a label-efficient framework that synergizes minimal expert supervision with abundant unlabeled data. First, to maximize the efficiency of a strict annotation budget, we propose density-uncertainty-weighted sampling. Unlike standard diversity or uncertainty strategies that risk selecting visual outliers, our method leverages density estimation to identify samples that are simultaneously diverse, representative, and informative. Second, to utilize the remaining unlabeled data without noise propagation, we construct a hybrid pool and introduce confidence-aware retrieval and confidence-aware prompting. These mechanisms explicitly model label reliability, retrieving demonstrations based on a composite score of similarity and confidence while enabling the MLLM to adaptively distinguish between verified ground truths and noisy pseudo-labels. Extensive experiments across nine diverse benchmarks using four MLLMs demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms various baselines in low-resource settings, achieving robust adaptation with minimal annotation costs.",

We realize a five-qubit instance of the protocol as an inter-register message-transfer pattern within a single circuit, rather than physical signaling, and evaluate its behavior under realistic device noise and compilation constraints. The circuit encodes branch-conditioned evolution of an observer subsystem whose dynamics depend on a control qubit, followed by a controlled transfer operation that probes correlations between conditional measurement contexts. Executing on the ibm_fez backend with 20000 shots, we observe population-based visibility of 0.877, coherence witnesses of 0.840 and -0.811 along orthogonal axes, and a phase-sensitive magnitude of approximately 1.17. While the visibility metric is insensitive to some classes of dephasing, the coherence witnesses provide complementary sensitivity to off-diagonal noise.",

      "abstract": "🚀 Introducing HERMES: The Future of Real-Time Streaming Video Understanding! While today's Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) perform impressively at offline video comprehension, they often face a \"painful trade-off\" when it comes to real-time streaming video - balancing real-time responses, low memory usage, and high accuracy. To solve this, we introduce the following innovations: 💡 The HERMES Breakthrough: 1️⃣ Novel memory architecture: By deeply analyzing attention mechanisms, we' ve introduced a \"Hierarchical Memory\" approach. The KV Cache is now reimagined as a multi-level memory framework: Shallow layers act as Sensory Memory (events that just happened). Deep layers focus on Long-term Memory (frame-level semantic anchors). Middle layers bridge the gap with Working Memory. 2️⃣ Plug-and-play architecture: HERMES achieves highly efficient KV Cache reuse and optimization strategies including cross-layer memory smoothing and position re-indexing , delivering instant responses without the need for additional training, or auxiliary computations when user queries arrive. 3️⃣ Incredible efficiency and performance: ⚡ Blazing speed: HERMES is 10x faster than previous SOTA in terms of response latency (TTFT)! 🚀 Compact efficiency: Even with 68% fewer video tokens, the model remains rock-solid, achieving up to 11.4% improvement in streaming comprehension tasks! 💾 Memory-friendly: No matter the video length, memory usage stays constant, leaving OOM errors in the past. 🔥 Join us in exploring this breakthrough: If you're passionate about streaming video understanding and efficient inference, we'd love to discuss and collaborate! 🔍 Explore the Details : 🔗 Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14724 💻 Code: https://github.com/haowei-freesky/HERMES 🌐 Project: https://hermes-streaming.github.io/",

      "abstract": "🏗️ Architecture BayesianVLA is a novel framework designed to solve the Vision Shortcut problem in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. In current VLA training, goal-driven datasets often make language instructions highly predictable from visual observations alone. This leads to Information Collapse, where the model ignores language and degenerates into a vision-only policy, failing miserably in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. BayesianVLA addresses this by: Bayesian Decomposition : Explicitly modeling a vision-only prior $p(a|v)$ and a language-conditioned posterior $\\pi(a|v, \\ell)$. LLR Optimization : Maximizing the Log-Likelihood Ratio (LLR) to penalize actions that rely solely on visual cues and reward actions that are truly grounded in language instructions. ✨ Key Features Dual-Branch Architecture : Uses learnable Latent Action Queries to decouple vision-only and language-conditioned action distributions. Zero Extra Data : Achieves significant performance gains (e.g., +11.3% on SimplerEnv) using the exact same datasets as baselines. Preserves VLM Intelligence : Effectively regularizes the model to prevent the \"catastrophic forgetting\" of general multimodal reasoning capabilities common in standard VLA fine-tuning.",

By treating masks as new language tokens, SAMTok enables base MLLMs (such as the QwenVL series) to learn pixel-wise capabilities through standard next-token prediction and simple reinforcement learning, without architectural modifications and specialized loss design. SAMTok builds on SAM2 and is trained on 209M diverse masks using a mask encoder and residual vector quantizer to produce discrete, compact, and information-rich tokens. With 5M SAMTok-formatted mask understanding and generation data samples, QwenVL-SAMTok attains state-of-the-art or comparable results on region captioning, region VQA, grounded conversation, referring segmentation, scene graph parsing, and multi-round interactive segmentation.",

      "abstract": "Summary of Key Points Kernel quality is a fundamental bottleneck for modern AI system performance, yet high-quality kernel engineering is expert-intensive, time-consuming, and difficult to scale. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and LLM-based agents enable automated kernel generation and optimization by capturing expert knowledge and supporting iterative, feedback-driven optimization loops. Despite rapid progress, existing work is fragmented and lacks a unified, systematic perspective. This survey provides a structured overview of LLM-based kernel generation methods and agentic optimization workflows, and compiles the key datasets and benchmarks used for training and evaluation. The paper further identifies open challenges and outlines future research directions, aiming to serve as a comprehensive reference for next-generation automated kernel optimization.

      "abstract": "Abstract: Generalizing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to novel video domains is essential for real-world deployment but remains challenging due to the scarcity of labeled data. While In-Context Learning (ICL) offers a training-free adaptation path, standard methods rely on large annotated pools, which are often impractical in specialized environments like industrial or surgical settings since they require the experts' annotations. To bridge this gap, we introduce VIOLA (Video In-cOntext Learning with minimal Annotation), a label-efficient framework that synergizes minimal expert supervision with abundant unlabeled data. First, to maximize the efficiency of a strict annotation budget, we propose density-uncertainty-weighted sampling. Unlike standard diversity or uncertainty strategies that risk selecting visual outliers, our method leverages density estimation to identify samples that are simultaneously diverse, representative, and informative. Second, to utilize the remaining unlabeled data without noise propagation, we construct a hybrid pool and introduce confidence-aware retrieval and confidence-aware prompting. These mechanisms explicitly model label reliability, retrieving demonstrations based on a composite score of similarity and confidence while enabling the MLLM to adaptively distinguish between verified ground truths and noisy pseudo-labels. Extensive experiments across nine diverse benchmarks using four MLLMs demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms various baselines in low-resource settings, achieving robust adaptation with minimal annotation costs.",

We realize a five-qubit instance of the protocol as an inter-register message-transfer pattern within a single circuit, rather than physical signaling, and evaluate its behavior under realistic device noise and compilation constraints. The circuit encodes branch-conditioned evolution of an observer subsystem whose dynamics depend on a control qubit, followed by a controlled transfer operation that probes correlations between conditional measurement contexts. Executing on the ibm_fez backend with 20000 shots, we observe population-based visibility of 0.877, coherence witnesses of 0.840 and -0.811 along orthogonal axes, and a phase-sensitive magnitude of approximately 1.17. While the visibility metric is insensitive to some classes of dephasing, the coherence witnesses provide complementary sensitivity to off-diagonal noise.",

Moreover, our finetuning process is highly efficient, requiring only 2,000 video samples and 1,600 training steps with a batch size of 8.",

      "title": "GameTalk: Training LLMs for Strategic Conversation",
      "abstract": "Strategic decision-making in multi-agent settings is a key challenge for large language models (LLMs), particularly when coordination and negotiation must unfold over extended conversations. While recent work has explored the use of LLMs in isolated decision tasks, little attention has been given to optimizing long-term objectives through dialogue. We introduce GameTalk, a framework for training LLMs to make strategic decisions via multi-turn interactions. Unlike prior work that focuses on single-turn objectives or static action prediction, we train LLMs to optimize a global objective across full conversations. We achieve this by adapting fine-tuning methods like GRPO, DPO, and STaR to incorporate reward signals that depend on the entire interaction. We evaluate this approach on a suite of increasingly complex games, designed to stress different aspects of reasoning, coordination, and opponent modeling. Our results show that GameTalk significantly outperforms untrained models, especially under reward shaping, with DPO consistently yielding the strongest gains. These findings position conversational fine-tuning as a promising path for LLMs to reason, negotiate, and act in interactive environments.",
