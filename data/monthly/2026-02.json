      "title": "MMFineReason: Closing the Multimodal Reasoning Gap via Open Data-Centric Methods",
      "abstract": "Recent advances in Vision Language Models (VLMs) have driven significant progress in visual reasoning. However, open-source VLMs still lag behind proprietary systems, largely due to the lack of high-quality reasoning data. Existing datasets offer limited coverage of challenging domains such as STEM diagrams and visual puzzles, and lack consistent, long-form Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations essential for eliciting strong reasoning capabilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce MMFineReason, a large-scale multimodal reasoning dataset comprising 1.8M samples and 5.1B solution tokens, featuring high-quality reasoning annotations distilled from Qwen3-VL-235B-A22B-Thinking. The dataset is established via a systematic three-stage pipeline: (1) large-scale data collection and standardization, (2) CoT rationale generation, and (3) comprehensive selection based on reasoning quality and difficulty awareness. The resulting dataset spans STEM problems, visual puzzles, games, and complex diagrams, with each sample annotated with visually grounded reasoning traces. We fine-tune Qwen3-VL-Instruct on MMFineReason to develop MMFineReason-2B/4B/8B versions. Our models establish new state-of-the-art results for their size class. Notably, MMFineReason-4B succesfully surpasses Qwen3-VL-8B-Thinking, and MMFineReason-8B even outperforms Qwen3-VL-30B-A3B-Thinking while approaching Qwen3-VL-32B-Thinking, demonstrating remarkable parameter efficiency. Crucially, we uncover a \"less is more\" phenomenon via our difficulty-aware filtering strategy: a subset of just 7% (123K samples) achieves performance comparable to the full dataset. Notably, we reveal a synergistic effect where reasoning-oriented data composition simultaneously boosts general capabilities.",

(2) Inherent efficiency: at compression ratio R=2, attention computation reduces by R²× and KV cache by R×, achieving prefill speedups up to 175% and decoding speedups up to 117%.

      "abstract": "The evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) into autonomous agents necessitates the management of extensive, dynamic contexts. Current benchmarks, however, remain largely static, relying on passive retrieval tasks that fail to simulate the complexities of agent-environment interaction, such as non-linear reasoning and iterative feedback. To address this, we introduce \\textbf{AgentLongBench}, which evaluates agents through simulated environment rollouts based on Lateral Thinking Puzzles. This framework generates rigorous interaction trajectories across knowledge-intensive and knowledge-free scenarios. Experiments with state-of-the-art models and memory systems (32K to 4M tokens) expose a critical weakness: while adept at static retrieval, agents struggle with the dynamic information synthesis essential for workflows. Our analysis indicates that this degradation is driven by the minimum number of tokens required to resolve a query. This factor explains why the high information density inherent in massive tool responses poses a significantly greater challenge than the memory fragmentation typical of long-turn dialogues.

      "abstract": "While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in language-based agentic tasks, their applicability to unseen, nonlinguistic environments (e.g., symbolic or spatial tasks) remains limited. Previous work attributes this performance gap to the mismatch between the pretraining distribution and the testing distribution. In this work, we demonstrate the primary bottleneck is the prohibitive cost of exploration: mastering these tasks requires extensive trial-and-error, which is computationally unsustainable for parameter-heavy LLMs operating in a high dimensional semantic space. To address this, we propose SCOUT (Sub-Scale Collaboration On Unseen Tasks), a novel framework that decouples exploration from exploitation. We employ lightweight \"scouts\" (e.g., small MLPs) to probe environmental dynamics at a speed and scale far exceeding LLMs. The collected trajectories are utilized to bootstrap the LLM via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), followed by multi-turn Reinforcement Learning (RL) to activate its latent world knowledge. Empirically, SCOUT enables a Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct model to achieve an average score of 0.86, significantly outperforming proprietary models, including Gemini-2.5-Pro (0.60), while saving about 60% GPU hours consumption.",

Most recent progress in LLM reasoning comes from RL post-training (GRPO, verifiers, rewards).

We show that: Reasoning trajectories already exist in base models What matters is how you sample, not how you retrain The global power distribution can be approximated autoregressively, without MCMC The result is a training-free, verifier-free inference-time method that: ⚡ Matches GRPO-style post-training ⏱ Is ~10× faster than MCMC-based power sampling 🧪 Requires no rewards, no finetuning, no verifier Conceptually, the key insight is simple: Power sampling ≈ low-temperature sampling × future-aware token scaling This lets us recover global reasoning behaviour token by token, without expensive trajectory-level inference.",

      "abstract": "Most offline preference optimization methods (e.g., DPO) constrain policy updates using token-level divergences. However, token-space similarity is often a weak proxy for semantic or structural behavior. We propose GANPO, a plug-and-play regularizer that introduces latent-space adversarial regularization, aligning the latent representation distributions of a policy and a reference model via a principled GAN-style divergence. We find consistent performance improvements. GANPO yields consistent gains across model architectures when integrated into OPO-style methods on AlpacaEval. We also find that structure is preserved. The adversarial objective acts as a geometry-preserving regularizer. Unlike DPO, which often degrades at high sampling temperatures (T ≥ 1.0), GANPO maintains structural coherence in high-entropy settings. If you’re interested in alignment, GANs, or the limitations of KL-divergence–based regularization, feel free to check out the paper.",

Extensive experiments show that VTC-R1 consistently improves reasoning accuracy across multiple benchmarks while achieving up to 3.4x token compression and 2.7x end-to-end inference speedup. The results demonstrate that VTC-R1 provides an effective alternative representation for scalable long-context reasoning.

      "abstract": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) suffer from cross-modal hallucinations, where one modality inappropriately influences generation about another, leading to fabricated output. This exposes a more fundamental deficiency in modality-interaction control. To address this, we propose Modality-Adaptive Decoding (MAD), a training-free method that adaptively weights modality-specific decoding branches based on task requirements. MAD leverages the model's inherent ability to self-assess modality relevance by querying which modalities are needed for each task. The extracted modality probabilities are then used to adaptively weight contrastive decoding branches, enabling the model to focus on relevant information while suppressing cross-modal interference. Extensive experiments on CMM and AVHBench demonstrate that MAD significantly reduces cross-modal hallucinations across multiple audio-visual language models (7.8% and 2.0% improvements for VideoLLaMA2-AV, 8.7% and 4.7% improvements for Qwen2.5-Omni). Our approach demonstrates that explicit modality awareness through self-assessment is crucial for robust multimodal reasoning, offering a principled extension to existing contrastive decoding methods.",

      "abstract": "The ability of visuomotor policies to generalize across tasks and environments critically depends on the structure of the underlying visual representations. While most state-of-the-art robot policies rely on either global or dense features from pre-trained vision models, these approaches often entangle task-relevant and irrelevant signals, limiting their robustness to visual distribution shifts. In this paper, we investigate Slot-based Object-Centric Representations (SOCRs) as a structured alternative that decomposes scenes into a finite set of object-like entities. We present the first large-scale, systematic comparison of global, dense, and object-centric representations across diverse simulated (METAWORLD, LIBERO) and real-world robotic manipulation tasks. Our results show that SOCRs enable superior policy performance and significantly improve generalization under shifts in lighting, texture, and clutter— even without task-specific tuning. We further demonstrate that pretraining SOCRs on robotic video datasets amplifies these benefits. Our findings highlight the importance of structured visual abstraction in robotic perception and suggest that SOCRs offer a promising pathway toward more robust and generaliz- able manipulation policies.",

      "title": "MMFineReason: Closing the Multimodal Reasoning Gap via Open Data-Centric Methods",
      "abstract": "Recent advances in Vision Language Models (VLMs) have driven significant progress in visual reasoning. However, open-source VLMs still lag behind proprietary systems, largely due to the lack of high-quality reasoning data. Existing datasets offer limited coverage of challenging domains such as STEM diagrams and visual puzzles, and lack consistent, long-form Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations essential for eliciting strong reasoning capabilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce MMFineReason, a large-scale multimodal reasoning dataset comprising 1.8M samples and 5.1B solution tokens, featuring high-quality reasoning annotations distilled from Qwen3-VL-235B-A22B-Thinking. The dataset is established via a systematic three-stage pipeline: (1) large-scale data collection and standardization, (2) CoT rationale generation, and (3) comprehensive selection based on reasoning quality and difficulty awareness. The resulting dataset spans STEM problems, visual puzzles, games, and complex diagrams, with each sample annotated with visually grounded reasoning traces. We fine-tune Qwen3-VL-Instruct on MMFineReason to develop MMFineReason-2B/4B/8B versions. Our models establish new state-of-the-art results for their size class. Notably, MMFineReason-4B succesfully surpasses Qwen3-VL-8B-Thinking, and MMFineReason-8B even outperforms Qwen3-VL-30B-A3B-Thinking while approaching Qwen3-VL-32B-Thinking, demonstrating remarkable parameter efficiency. Crucially, we uncover a \"less is more\" phenomenon via our difficulty-aware filtering strategy: a subset of just 7% (123K samples) achieves performance comparable to the full dataset. Notably, we reveal a synergistic effect where reasoning-oriented data composition simultaneously boosts general capabilities.",

(2) Inherent efficiency: at compression ratio R=2, attention computation reduces by R²× and KV cache by R×, achieving prefill speedups up to 175% and decoding speedups up to 117%. (3) Minimal architectural changes (chunk module + decoder QKV projectors) enable straightforward deployment in existing MoE systems.

      "abstract": "The evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) into autonomous agents necessitates the management of extensive, dynamic contexts. Current benchmarks, however, remain largely static, relying on passive retrieval tasks that fail to simulate the complexities of agent-environment interaction, such as non-linear reasoning and iterative feedback. To address this, we introduce \\textbf{AgentLongBench}, which evaluates agents through simulated environment rollouts based on Lateral Thinking Puzzles. This framework generates rigorous interaction trajectories across knowledge-intensive and knowledge-free scenarios. Experiments with state-of-the-art models and memory systems (32K to 4M tokens) expose a critical weakness: while adept at static retrieval, agents struggle with the dynamic information synthesis essential for workflows. Our analysis indicates that this degradation is driven by the minimum number of tokens required to resolve a query. This factor explains why the high information density inherent in massive tool responses poses a significantly greater challenge than the memory fragmentation typical of long-turn dialogues. The code is available at https://github.com/euReKa025/AgentLongBench .",

Token-level Filtering vs Document-level Filtering (Figure 3) Token filtering Pareto-dominates document filtering : Can achieve equal reduction in undesired capabilities (equal medical loss) at lower cost to desired capabilities (lower biology loss) More precise filtering preserves beneficial content better 2. Scaling Effects (Figures 1, 4, 5, 6) Filtering gets more effective with scale : 1.8B parameter models see 7,000× compute slowdown on medical domain Document filtering: ~30× slowdown Token removal: >7,000× slowdown Multiple choice evaluation : Models score near chance on MedMCQA and MedQA-USMLE (medical), but maintain performance on retain domains Free response : Token filtering reduces medical answer correctness up to 20×, relevance/coherence 3× compared to baseline 3. Robustness to Attacks (Figure 7) 10× more robust than unlearning against adversarial finetuning attacks for 1.8B models State-of-the-art unlearning (RMU) requires 13× fewer tokens to recover capabilities compared to token removal 4. Alignment Compatibility (Figures 8, 9) Models can still be aligned on forget domain : Token-level filtering makes refusal training easier (2× better refusal generalization) Document filtering struggles with alignment generalization Linear probes show models can distinguish forget vs. retain tokens despite filtering 5. Classifier Training (Table 1, Figure 11) Small, task-specific models outperform large general ones : 224M parameter biLM achieves 0.894 F1 on test set Outperforms 395M ModernBERT-large (0.794 F1) Domain-specific pretraining improves performance 6. Label Quality Tolerance (Figures 12, 13, 14, 15) Robust to imperfect labels : Aggressive filtering with sufficient compute can overcome label noise Token-level classifiers generalize from weak labels better than document-level Can trade precision for recall to maintain effectiveness",

      "abstract": "While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in language-based agentic tasks, their applicability to unseen, nonlinguistic environments (e.g., symbolic or spatial tasks) remains limited. Previous work attributes this performance gap to the mismatch between the pretraining distribution and the testing distribution. In this work, we demonstrate the primary bottleneck is the prohibitive cost of exploration: mastering these tasks requires extensive trial-and-error, which is computationally unsustainable for parameter-heavy LLMs operating in a high dimensional semantic space. To address this, we propose SCOUT (Sub-Scale Collaboration On Unseen Tasks), a novel framework that decouples exploration from exploitation. We employ lightweight \"scouts\" (e.g., small MLPs) to probe environmental dynamics at a speed and scale far exceeding LLMs. The collected trajectories are utilized to bootstrap the LLM via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), followed by multi-turn Reinforcement Learning (RL) to activate its latent world knowledge. Empirically, SCOUT enables a Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct model to achieve an average score of 0.86, significantly outperforming proprietary models, including Gemini-2.5-Pro (0.60), while saving about 60% GPU hours consumption.",

      "abstract": "Most offline preference optimization methods (e.g., DPO) constrain policy updates using token-level divergences. However, token-space similarity is often a weak proxy for semantic or structural behavior. We propose GANPO, a plug-and-play regularizer that introduces latent-space adversarial regularization, aligning the latent representation distributions of a policy and a reference model via a principled GAN-style divergence. We find consistent performance improvements. GANPO yields consistent gains across model architectures when integrated into OPO-style methods on AlpacaEval. We also find that structure is preserved. The adversarial objective acts as a geometry-preserving regularizer. Unlike DPO, which often degrades at high sampling temperatures (T ≥ 1.0), GANPO maintains structural coherence in high-entropy settings. If you’re interested in alignment, GANs, or the limitations of KL-divergence–based regularization, feel free to check out the paper.",

Most recent progress in LLM reasoning comes from RL post-training (GRPO, verifiers, rewards). But there’s growing evidence that these gains may come less from learning new capabilities and more from reshaping the distribution of outputs. In our new work, we take that idea seriously. We show that: Reasoning trajectories already exist in base models What matters is how you sample, not how you retrain The global power distribution can be approximated autoregressively, without MCMC The result is a training-free, verifier-free inference-time method that: ⚡ Matches GRPO-style post-training ⏱ Is ~10× faster than MCMC-based power sampling 🧪 Requires no rewards, no finetuning, no verifier Conceptually, the key insight is simple: Power sampling ≈ low-temperature sampling × future-aware token scaling This lets us recover global reasoning behaviour token by token, without expensive trajectory-level inference.",

      "abstract": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) suffer from cross-modal hallucinations, where one modality inappropriately influences generation about another, leading to fabricated output. This exposes a more fundamental deficiency in modality-interaction control. To address this, we propose Modality-Adaptive Decoding (MAD), a training-free method that adaptively weights modality-specific decoding branches based on task requirements. MAD leverages the model's inherent ability to self-assess modality relevance by querying which modalities are needed for each task. The extracted modality probabilities are then used to adaptively weight contrastive decoding branches, enabling the model to focus on relevant information while suppressing cross-modal interference. Extensive experiments on CMM and AVHBench demonstrate that MAD significantly reduces cross-modal hallucinations across multiple audio-visual language models (7.8% and 2.0% improvements for VideoLLaMA2-AV, 8.7% and 4.7% improvements for Qwen2.5-Omni). Our approach demonstrates that explicit modality awareness through self-assessment is crucial for robust multimodal reasoning, offering a principled extension to existing contrastive decoding methods.",

      "abstract": "The ability of visuomotor policies to generalize across tasks and environments critically depends on the structure of the underlying visual representations. While most state-of-the-art robot policies rely on either global or dense features from pre-trained vision models, these approaches often entangle task-relevant and irrelevant signals, limiting their robustness to visual distribution shifts. In this paper, we investigate Slot-based Object-Centric Representations (SOCRs) as a structured alternative that decomposes scenes into a finite set of object-like entities. We present the first large-scale, systematic comparison of global, dense, and object-centric representations across diverse simulated (METAWORLD, LIBERO) and real-world robotic manipulation tasks. Our results show that SOCRs enable superior policy performance and significantly improve generalization under shifts in lighting, texture, and clutter— even without task-specific tuning. We further demonstrate that pretraining SOCRs on robotic video datasets amplifies these benefits. Our findings highlight the importance of structured visual abstraction in robotic perception and suggest that SOCRs offer a promising pathway toward more robust and generaliz- able manipulation policies.",

Our method obtains strong generalization improvements over existing VFM by simply adding a few layers of structure and keeping the backbone frozen. We hope this work can lead to more work going in the direction of adding structure in the visual inputs for robotics manipulation.",
