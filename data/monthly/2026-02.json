      "title": "MMFineReason: Closing the Multimodal Reasoning Gap via Open Data-Centric Methods",
      "abstract": "Recent advances in Vision Language Models (VLMs) have driven significant progress in visual reasoning. However, open-source VLMs still lag behind proprietary systems, largely due to the lack of high-quality reasoning data. Existing datasets offer limited coverage of challenging domains such as STEM diagrams and visual puzzles, and lack consistent, long-form Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations essential for eliciting strong reasoning capabilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce MMFineReason, a large-scale multimodal reasoning dataset comprising 1.8M samples and 5.1B solution tokens, featuring high-quality reasoning annotations distilled from Qwen3-VL-235B-A22B-Thinking. The dataset is established via a systematic three-stage pipeline: (1) large-scale data collection and standardization, (2) CoT rationale generation, and (3) comprehensive selection based on reasoning quality and difficulty awareness. The resulting dataset spans STEM problems, visual puzzles, games, and complex diagrams, with each sample annotated with visually grounded reasoning traces. We fine-tune Qwen3-VL-Instruct on MMFineReason to develop MMFineReason-2B/4B/8B versions. Our models establish new state-of-the-art results for their size class. Notably, MMFineReason-4B succesfully surpasses Qwen3-VL-8B-Thinking, and MMFineReason-8B even outperforms Qwen3-VL-30B-A3B-Thinking while approaching Qwen3-VL-32B-Thinking, demonstrating remarkable parameter efficiency. Crucially, we uncover a \"less is more\" phenomenon via our difficulty-aware filtering strategy: a subset of just 7% (123K samples) achieves performance comparable to the full dataset. Notably, we reveal a synergistic effect where reasoning-oriented data composition simultaneously boosts general capabilities.",

(2) Inherent efficiency: at compression ratio R=2, attention computation reduces by R²× and KV cache by R×, achieving prefill speedups up to 175% and decoding speedups up to 117%.

      "abstract": "The evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) into autonomous agents necessitates the management of extensive, dynamic contexts. Current benchmarks, however, remain largely static, relying on passive retrieval tasks that fail to simulate the complexities of agent-environment interaction, such as non-linear reasoning and iterative feedback. To address this, we introduce \\textbf{AgentLongBench}, which evaluates agents through simulated environment rollouts based on Lateral Thinking Puzzles. This framework generates rigorous interaction trajectories across knowledge-intensive and knowledge-free scenarios. Experiments with state-of-the-art models and memory systems (32K to 4M tokens) expose a critical weakness: while adept at static retrieval, agents struggle with the dynamic information synthesis essential for workflows. Our analysis indicates that this degradation is driven by the minimum number of tokens required to resolve a query. This factor explains why the high information density inherent in massive tool responses poses a significantly greater challenge than the memory fragmentation typical of long-turn dialogues.

      "abstract": "While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in language-based agentic tasks, their applicability to unseen, nonlinguistic environments (e.g., symbolic or spatial tasks) remains limited. Previous work attributes this performance gap to the mismatch between the pretraining distribution and the testing distribution. In this work, we demonstrate the primary bottleneck is the prohibitive cost of exploration: mastering these tasks requires extensive trial-and-error, which is computationally unsustainable for parameter-heavy LLMs operating in a high dimensional semantic space. To address this, we propose SCOUT (Sub-Scale Collaboration On Unseen Tasks), a novel framework that decouples exploration from exploitation. We employ lightweight \"scouts\" (e.g., small MLPs) to probe environmental dynamics at a speed and scale far exceeding LLMs. The collected trajectories are utilized to bootstrap the LLM via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), followed by multi-turn Reinforcement Learning (RL) to activate its latent world knowledge. Empirically, SCOUT enables a Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct model to achieve an average score of 0.86, significantly outperforming proprietary models, including Gemini-2.5-Pro (0.60), while saving about 60% GPU hours consumption.",

Most recent progress in LLM reasoning comes from RL post-training (GRPO, verifiers, rewards).

We show that: Reasoning trajectories already exist in base models What matters is how you sample, not how you retrain The global power distribution can be approximated autoregressively, without MCMC The result is a training-free, verifier-free inference-time method that: ⚡ Matches GRPO-style post-training ⏱ Is ~10× faster than MCMC-based power sampling 🧪 Requires no rewards, no finetuning, no verifier Conceptually, the key insight is simple: Power sampling ≈ low-temperature sampling × future-aware token scaling This lets us recover global reasoning behaviour token by token, without expensive trajectory-level inference.",

      "abstract": "Most offline preference optimization methods (e.g., DPO) constrain policy updates using token-level divergences. However, token-space similarity is often a weak proxy for semantic or structural behavior. We propose GANPO, a plug-and-play regularizer that introduces latent-space adversarial regularization, aligning the latent representation distributions of a policy and a reference model via a principled GAN-style divergence. We find consistent performance improvements. GANPO yields consistent gains across model architectures when integrated into OPO-style methods on AlpacaEval. We also find that structure is preserved. The adversarial objective acts as a geometry-preserving regularizer. Unlike DPO, which often degrades at high sampling temperatures (T ≥ 1.0), GANPO maintains structural coherence in high-entropy settings. If you’re interested in alignment, GANs, or the limitations of KL-divergence–based regularization, feel free to check out the paper.",

Extensive experiments show that VTC-R1 consistently improves reasoning accuracy across multiple benchmarks while achieving up to 3.4x token compression and 2.7x end-to-end inference speedup. The results demonstrate that VTC-R1 provides an effective alternative representation for scalable long-context reasoning.

      "abstract": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) suffer from cross-modal hallucinations, where one modality inappropriately influences generation about another, leading to fabricated output. This exposes a more fundamental deficiency in modality-interaction control. To address this, we propose Modality-Adaptive Decoding (MAD), a training-free method that adaptively weights modality-specific decoding branches based on task requirements. MAD leverages the model's inherent ability to self-assess modality relevance by querying which modalities are needed for each task. The extracted modality probabilities are then used to adaptively weight contrastive decoding branches, enabling the model to focus on relevant information while suppressing cross-modal interference. Extensive experiments on CMM and AVHBench demonstrate that MAD significantly reduces cross-modal hallucinations across multiple audio-visual language models (7.8% and 2.0% improvements for VideoLLaMA2-AV, 8.7% and 4.7% improvements for Qwen2.5-Omni). Our approach demonstrates that explicit modality awareness through self-assessment is crucial for robust multimodal reasoning, offering a principled extension to existing contrastive decoding methods.",

      "abstract": "The ability of visuomotor policies to generalize across tasks and environments critically depends on the structure of the underlying visual representations. While most state-of-the-art robot policies rely on either global or dense features from pre-trained vision models, these approaches often entangle task-relevant and irrelevant signals, limiting their robustness to visual distribution shifts. In this paper, we investigate Slot-based Object-Centric Representations (SOCRs) as a structured alternative that decomposes scenes into a finite set of object-like entities. We present the first large-scale, systematic comparison of global, dense, and object-centric representations across diverse simulated (METAWORLD, LIBERO) and real-world robotic manipulation tasks. Our results show that SOCRs enable superior policy performance and significantly improve generalization under shifts in lighting, texture, and clutter— even without task-specific tuning. We further demonstrate that pretraining SOCRs on robotic video datasets amplifies these benefits. Our findings highlight the importance of structured visual abstraction in robotic perception and suggest that SOCRs offer a promising pathway toward more robust and generaliz- able manipulation policies.",

      "title": "MMFineReason: Closing the Multimodal Reasoning Gap via Open Data-Centric Methods",
      "abstract": "Recent advances in Vision Language Models (VLMs) have driven significant progress in visual reasoning. However, open-source VLMs still lag behind proprietary systems, largely due to the lack of high-quality reasoning data. Existing datasets offer limited coverage of challenging domains such as STEM diagrams and visual puzzles, and lack consistent, long-form Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations essential for eliciting strong reasoning capabilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce MMFineReason, a large-scale multimodal reasoning dataset comprising 1.8M samples and 5.1B solution tokens, featuring high-quality reasoning annotations distilled from Qwen3-VL-235B-A22B-Thinking. The dataset is established via a systematic three-stage pipeline: (1) large-scale data collection and standardization, (2) CoT rationale generation, and (3) comprehensive selection based on reasoning quality and difficulty awareness. The resulting dataset spans STEM problems, visual puzzles, games, and complex diagrams, with each sample annotated with visually grounded reasoning traces. We fine-tune Qwen3-VL-Instruct on MMFineReason to develop MMFineReason-2B/4B/8B versions. Our models establish new state-of-the-art results for their size class. Notably, MMFineReason-4B succesfully surpasses Qwen3-VL-8B-Thinking, and MMFineReason-8B even outperforms Qwen3-VL-30B-A3B-Thinking while approaching Qwen3-VL-32B-Thinking, demonstrating remarkable parameter efficiency. Crucially, we uncover a \"less is more\" phenomenon via our difficulty-aware filtering strategy: a subset of just 7% (123K samples) achieves performance comparable to the full dataset. Notably, we reveal a synergistic effect where reasoning-oriented data composition simultaneously boosts general capabilities.",

(2) Inherent efficiency: at compression ratio R=2, attention computation reduces by R²× and KV cache by R×, achieving prefill speedups up to 175% and decoding speedups up to 117%. (3) Minimal architectural changes (chunk module + decoder QKV projectors) enable straightforward deployment in existing MoE systems.

      "abstract": "The evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) into autonomous agents necessitates the management of extensive, dynamic contexts. Current benchmarks, however, remain largely static, relying on passive retrieval tasks that fail to simulate the complexities of agent-environment interaction, such as non-linear reasoning and iterative feedback. To address this, we introduce \\textbf{AgentLongBench}, which evaluates agents through simulated environment rollouts based on Lateral Thinking Puzzles. This framework generates rigorous interaction trajectories across knowledge-intensive and knowledge-free scenarios. Experiments with state-of-the-art models and memory systems (32K to 4M tokens) expose a critical weakness: while adept at static retrieval, agents struggle with the dynamic information synthesis essential for workflows. Our analysis indicates that this degradation is driven by the minimum number of tokens required to resolve a query. This factor explains why the high information density inherent in massive tool responses poses a significantly greater challenge than the memory fragmentation typical of long-turn dialogues. The code is available at https://github.com/euReKa025/AgentLongBench .",

Token-level Filtering vs Document-level Filtering (Figure 3) Token filtering Pareto-dominates document filtering : Can achieve equal reduction in undesired capabilities (equal medical loss) at lower cost to desired capabilities (lower biology loss) More precise filtering preserves beneficial content better 2. Scaling Effects (Figures 1, 4, 5, 6) Filtering gets more effective with scale : 1.8B parameter models see 7,000× compute slowdown on medical domain Document filtering: ~30× slowdown Token removal: >7,000× slowdown Multiple choice evaluation : Models score near chance on MedMCQA and MedQA-USMLE (medical), but maintain performance on retain domains Free response : Token filtering reduces medical answer correctness up to 20×, relevance/coherence 3× compared to baseline 3. Robustness to Attacks (Figure 7) 10× more robust than unlearning against adversarial finetuning attacks for 1.8B models State-of-the-art unlearning (RMU) requires 13× fewer tokens to recover capabilities compared to token removal 4. Alignment Compatibility (Figures 8, 9) Models can still be aligned on forget domain : Token-level filtering makes refusal training easier (2× better refusal generalization) Document filtering struggles with alignment generalization Linear probes show models can distinguish forget vs. retain tokens despite filtering 5. Classifier Training (Table 1, Figure 11) Small, task-specific models outperform large general ones : 224M parameter biLM achieves 0.894 F1 on test set Outperforms 395M ModernBERT-large (0.794 F1) Domain-specific pretraining improves performance 6. Label Quality Tolerance (Figures 12, 13, 14, 15) Robust to imperfect labels : Aggressive filtering with sufficient compute can overcome label noise Token-level classifiers generalize from weak labels better than document-level Can trade precision for recall to maintain effectiveness",

      "abstract": "While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in language-based agentic tasks, their applicability to unseen, nonlinguistic environments (e.g., symbolic or spatial tasks) remains limited. Previous work attributes this performance gap to the mismatch between the pretraining distribution and the testing distribution. In this work, we demonstrate the primary bottleneck is the prohibitive cost of exploration: mastering these tasks requires extensive trial-and-error, which is computationally unsustainable for parameter-heavy LLMs operating in a high dimensional semantic space. To address this, we propose SCOUT (Sub-Scale Collaboration On Unseen Tasks), a novel framework that decouples exploration from exploitation. We employ lightweight \"scouts\" (e.g., small MLPs) to probe environmental dynamics at a speed and scale far exceeding LLMs. The collected trajectories are utilized to bootstrap the LLM via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), followed by multi-turn Reinforcement Learning (RL) to activate its latent world knowledge. Empirically, SCOUT enables a Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct model to achieve an average score of 0.86, significantly outperforming proprietary models, including Gemini-2.5-Pro (0.60), while saving about 60% GPU hours consumption.",

      "abstract": "Most offline preference optimization methods (e.g., DPO) constrain policy updates using token-level divergences. However, token-space similarity is often a weak proxy for semantic or structural behavior. We propose GANPO, a plug-and-play regularizer that introduces latent-space adversarial regularization, aligning the latent representation distributions of a policy and a reference model via a principled GAN-style divergence. We find consistent performance improvements. GANPO yields consistent gains across model architectures when integrated into OPO-style methods on AlpacaEval. We also find that structure is preserved. The adversarial objective acts as a geometry-preserving regularizer. Unlike DPO, which often degrades at high sampling temperatures (T ≥ 1.0), GANPO maintains structural coherence in high-entropy settings. If you’re interested in alignment, GANs, or the limitations of KL-divergence–based regularization, feel free to check out the paper.",

Most recent progress in LLM reasoning comes from RL post-training (GRPO, verifiers, rewards). But there’s growing evidence that these gains may come less from learning new capabilities and more from reshaping the distribution of outputs. In our new work, we take that idea seriously. We show that: Reasoning trajectories already exist in base models What matters is how you sample, not how you retrain The global power distribution can be approximated autoregressively, without MCMC The result is a training-free, verifier-free inference-time method that: ⚡ Matches GRPO-style post-training ⏱ Is ~10× faster than MCMC-based power sampling 🧪 Requires no rewards, no finetuning, no verifier Conceptually, the key insight is simple: Power sampling ≈ low-temperature sampling × future-aware token scaling This lets us recover global reasoning behaviour token by token, without expensive trajectory-level inference.",

      "abstract": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) suffer from cross-modal hallucinations, where one modality inappropriately influences generation about another, leading to fabricated output. This exposes a more fundamental deficiency in modality-interaction control. To address this, we propose Modality-Adaptive Decoding (MAD), a training-free method that adaptively weights modality-specific decoding branches based on task requirements. MAD leverages the model's inherent ability to self-assess modality relevance by querying which modalities are needed for each task. The extracted modality probabilities are then used to adaptively weight contrastive decoding branches, enabling the model to focus on relevant information while suppressing cross-modal interference. Extensive experiments on CMM and AVHBench demonstrate that MAD significantly reduces cross-modal hallucinations across multiple audio-visual language models (7.8% and 2.0% improvements for VideoLLaMA2-AV, 8.7% and 4.7% improvements for Qwen2.5-Omni). Our approach demonstrates that explicit modality awareness through self-assessment is crucial for robust multimodal reasoning, offering a principled extension to existing contrastive decoding methods.",

      "abstract": "The ability of visuomotor policies to generalize across tasks and environments critically depends on the structure of the underlying visual representations. While most state-of-the-art robot policies rely on either global or dense features from pre-trained vision models, these approaches often entangle task-relevant and irrelevant signals, limiting their robustness to visual distribution shifts. In this paper, we investigate Slot-based Object-Centric Representations (SOCRs) as a structured alternative that decomposes scenes into a finite set of object-like entities. We present the first large-scale, systematic comparison of global, dense, and object-centric representations across diverse simulated (METAWORLD, LIBERO) and real-world robotic manipulation tasks. Our results show that SOCRs enable superior policy performance and significantly improve generalization under shifts in lighting, texture, and clutter— even without task-specific tuning. We further demonstrate that pretraining SOCRs on robotic video datasets amplifies these benefits.

      "abstract": "Our analysis revealed a phenomenon we term Manifold Realignment. RLVR is a Trajectory Optimizer : We found that RLVR irreversibly reorganizes the local geometry of the latent manifold but largely preserves the global manifold geometry (the overall map of knowledge) and the linear readout of base models. Coordinate basis will alter substantially and reversibly only under prolonged RLVR. Contrastive Learning acts as an Equalizer : When we fine-tune these models to embedding models, the contrastive loss forces the base and reasoning models to align strongly again. The Takeaway for Practitioners: Our results suggest that the \"reasoning\" capability in current models is a learned policy for navigating the latent manifold , rather than a fundamental restructuring of the knowledge map itself. As latent-space-centric paradigms such as World Models and JEPA gain prominence, our findings point to a practical trade-off: RLVR tends to preserve the base model’s representational backbone (which may help retain broad generalization), yet on its own is unlikely to fundamentally improve the underlying global organization of the latent manifold. If RLVR’s distinctive footprint is local geometry reorganization under global geometry stability, then similar behavior might be achievable via SFT augmented with geometry- and basis-aware regularization .",

In this work, we delve into the inherent spectral characteristics of dLLMs and present the first frequency-domain analysis showing that low-frequency components in hidden states primarily encode global structural information and long-range dependencies, while high-frequency components are responsible for characterizing local details. Based on this observation, we propose FourierSampler, which leverages a frequency-domain sliding window mechanism to dynamically guide the model to achieve a \"structure-to-detail\" generation. FourierSampler outperforms other inference enhancement strategies on LLADA and SDAR, achieving relative improvements of 20.4% on LLaDA1.5-8B and 16.0% on LLaDA-8B-Instruct. It notably surpasses similarly sized autoregressive models like Llama3.1-8B-Instruct. Code is available at https://github.com/ShirleYoung/FourierSampler .",

      "title": "DreamActor-M2: Universal Character Image Animation via Spatiotemporal In-Context Learning",
      "abstract": "Character image animation aims to synthesize high-fidelity videos by transferring motion from a driving sequence to a static reference image. Despite recent advancements, existing methods suffer from two fundamental challenges: (1) suboptimal motion injection strategies that lead to a trade-off between identity preservation and motion consistency, manifesting as a \"see-saw\", and (2) an over-reliance on explicit pose priors (e.g., skeletons), which inadequately capture intricate dynamics and hinder generalization to arbitrary, non-humanoid characters. To address these challenges, we present DreamActor-M2, a universal animation framework that reimagines motion conditioning as an in-context learning problem. Our approach follows a two-stage paradigm. First, we bridge the input modality gap by fusing reference appearance and motion cues into a unified latent space, enabling the model to jointly reason about spatial identity and temporal dynamics by leveraging the generative prior of foundational models. Second, we introduce a self-bootstrapped data synthesis pipeline that curates pseudo cross-identity training pairs, facilitating a seamless transition from pose-dependent control to direct, end-to-end RGB-driven animation. This strategy significantly enhances generalization across diverse characters and motion scenarios. To facilitate comprehensive evaluation, we further introduce AW Bench, a versatile benchmark encompassing a wide spectrum of characters types and motion scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DreamActor-M2 achieves state-of-the-art performance, delivering superior visual fidelity and robust cross-domain generalization.

      "abstract": "RM -RF: Reward Model for Run-Free Unit Test Evaluation proposes a novel lightweight reward model  that predicts unit test quality without compiling or executing code by inferring three execution-derived signals directly from source and test code: whether the augmented test suite would compile and run, whether the new tests increase code coverage, whether they improve mutation kill rate. This work is motivated by the high computational cost of traditional compile-and-run validation in automated test generation, especially when using large language models (LLMs) for code tasks. RM-RF is trained on a multilingual dataset across Java, Python, and Go that pairs code + test files with execution-derived labels, and various model families and tuning regimes (zero-shot, fine-tuned, PEFT/LoRA) achieve ~0.69 F1 on the three targets. Key contributions include: a scalable “run-free” reward model that reduces latency and infrastructure needs compared to execution-based evaluation, a curated dataset and methodology for comparative assessment of unit test quality signals, empirical analysis of RM-RF with different model sizes and fine-tuning strategies. This approach can provide rapid feedback for large-scale test generation and RL-based code optimization, bridging a gap between high-fidelity execution feedback and scalable automated unit test evaluation.",

This paper introduces TAM-Eval , the benchmark and evaluation framework that targets exactly these maintenance tasks in realistic software contexts. Core contributions: 🔹 Benchmark and framework: TAM-Eval evaluates LLMs on three maintenance scenarios — creation , repair , and updating of test suites — at the test file level with actual context (not isolated function snippets). 🔹 Real-world dataset: The benchmark is built from 1,539 automatically extracted and validated scenarios from open-source projects in Python, Java, and Go. 🔹 Evaluation metrics: Instead of simple accuracy scores, the framework uses reference-free metrics reflecting real software quality: Test suite pass rate Code coverage change Mutation testing outcomes These align closer to developer goals in maintenance. 🔹 Empirical results: State-of-the-art LLMs show only limited improvements on realistic maintenance workflows — indicating that current models still struggle with practical test suite evolution. Why it matters: Automated testing and maintenance are essential for high-quality software. Most benchmarks have focused on test generation at function level; TAM-Eval shifts the focus to maintenance workflows developers actually deal with , providing a new community standard for evaluating LLMs in software engineering contexts. Open science: The TAM-Eval code and dataset are fully open-source, enabling future research and direct integration into evaluation pipelines.",

      "abstract": "🚀 New Research Alert! 🧠✨ We’re excited to share our latest work: Deep Search with Hierarchical Meta-Cognitive Monitoring Inspired by Cognitive Neuroscience 🔍 What’s the key idea? Deep search agents powered by LLMs excel at multi-step reasoning and retrieval—but they often fail silently when small errors accumulate under uncertainty. Drawing direct inspiration from human cognitive neuroscience , we propose a hierarchical meta-cognitive monitoring framework that mirrors how humans detect anomalies, reflect on mistakes, and adapt their behavior during complex problem solving. 🧠 Neuroscience-inspired design Human metacognition is not monolithic: it combines fast, automatic error signals with slower, experience-driven reflection . We translate this principle into deep search agents via two complementary monitors: 🧩 Our approach introduces two complementary monitors: ⚡ Fast Consistency Monitor Inspired by rapid neural mechanisms for conflict and surprise detection (e.g., early mismatch and uncertainty signals), this module performs lightweight, always-on checks to detect misalignment between external evidence and internal reasoning confidence . 🐢 Slow Experience-Driven Monitor Inspired by higher-order reflective processes and memory-based control in the human brain, this module is selectively activated . It leverages experience from past trajectories to guide deliberate correction and strategic adjustment. 📈 Why does this matter? By embedding neuroscience-inspired meta-cognitive monitoring directly into the ReAct loop of a Deep Search Agent, our framework: Enhances robustness and reliability in long-horizon reasoning Enables early detection and correction of cascading errors Establishes a tighter conceptual bridge between human metacognition and agentic AI system design 🧪 Results Experiments across multiple deep search benchmarks and backbone models demonstrate consistent improvements in both performance and robustness , validating the effectiveness of this cognitively grounded design.",

A key reason? Distribution shift—the policy keeps changing, while the reward model stays static. R2M (Real-Time Aligned Reward Model) tackles this head-on. Instead of relying only on fixed semantic features, R2M feeds on the policy’s evolving hidden states, aligning the reward model in real time with the policy’s trajectory during RL. 🔑 Takeaway: Reward models shouldn’t be passive judges.

      "abstract": "End-to-end autonomous driving increasingly leverages self-supervised video pretraining to learn transferable planning representations. However, pretraining video world models for scene understanding has so far brought only limited improvements. This limitation is compounded by the inherent ambiguity of driving: each scene typically provides only a single human trajectory, making it difficult to learn multimodal behaviors. In this work, we propose Drive-JEPA, a framework that integrates Video Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (V-JEPA) with multimodal trajectory distillation for end-to-end driving. First, we adapt V-JEPA for end-to-end driving, pretraining a ViT encoder on large-scale driving videos to produce predictive representations aligned with trajectory planning. Second, we introduce a proposal-centric planner that distills diverse simulator-generated trajectories alongside human trajectories, with a momentum-aware selection mechanism to promote stable and safe behavior. When evaluated on NAVSIM, the V-JEPA representation combined with a simple transformer-based decoder outperforms prior methods by 3 PDMS in the perception-free setting. The complete Drive-JEPA framework achieves 93.3 PDMS on v1 and 87.8 EPDMS on v2, setting a new state-of-the-art.",

We propose ExpAlign, a theoretically grounded vision-language alignment framework built on a principled multiple instance learning formulation. ExpAlign introduces an Expectation Alignment Head that performs attentionbased soft MIL pooling over token-region similarities, enabling implicit token and instance selection without additional annotations. To further stabilize alignment learning, we develop an energy-based multi-scale consistency regularization scheme, including a Top-K multi-positive contrastive objective and a Geometry-Aware Consistency Objective derived from a Lagrangianconstrained free-energy minimization. Extensive experiments show that ExpAlign consistently improves open-vocabulary detection and zero-shot instance segmentation, particularly on long-tail categories. Most notably, it achieves 36.2 APron the LVIS minival split, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods at comparable model scale, while remaining lightweight and inference efficient.",

That hope is getting expensive. If the “AGI won’t happen from brute-force scaling” camp is even partly right, then the bottleneck is clear: value per gradient step. So we asked a practical question: Can a small amount of verified goal information steer the massive unlabeled pretraining phase—without turning pretraining into supervised finetuning? A potential answer: V‑Pretraining (Value‑Based Pre‑Training with Downstream Feedback). https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22108 .

      "abstract": "We introduce KAPSO, a modular framework for autonomous program synthesis and optimization. Given a natural language goal and an evaluation method, KAPSO iteratively performs ideation, code synthesis and editing, execution, evaluation, and learning to improve a runnable artifact toward measurable objectives. Rather than treating synthesis as the endpoint, KAPSO uses synthesis as an operator within a long-horizon optimization loop, where progress is defined by evaluator outcomes. KAPSO targets long-horizon failures common in coding agents, including lost experimental state, brittle debugging, and weak reuse of domain expertise, by integrating three tightly coupled components. First, a git-native experimentation engine isolates each attempt as a branch, producing reproducible artifacts and preserving provenance across iterations. Second, a knowledge system ingests heterogeneous sources, including repositories, internal playbooks, and curated external resources such as documentation, scientific papers, and web search results, and organizes them into a structured representation that supports retrieval over workflows, implementations, and environment constraints. Third, a cognitive memory layer coordinates retrieval and maintains an episodic store of reusable lessons distilled from experiment traces (run logs, diffs, and evaluator feedback), reducing repeated error modes and accelerating convergence. We evaluated KAPSO on MLE-Bench (Kaggle-style ML competitions) and ALE-Bench (AtCoder heuristic optimization), and report end-to-end performance.

      "abstract": "TL;DR: Scaling VLA isn’t enough—you need quality-aligned trajectories + a unified action interface + staged RL refinement to get reliable cross-robot generalization. This work (1) introduces a unified R64 action space with a fixed semantic layout plus embodiment/control-type prompts and a masked BC loss so unused DoFs don’t inject spurious gradients, (2) normalizes heterogeneous demonstration speeds via optical-flow–based temporal resampling to align motion statistics across datasets, and (3) follows a staged recipe R0 → R1 → R2, where R2 RL alignment explicitly targets long-horizon consistency and error recovery. On real bimanual table cleaning (ALOHA), it reaches 69.5% first-item success vs 35.6% for the baseline and is ~2× faster (1m35s vs 2m59s). On Simpler (Google Robot), performance improves from 60.2 (R0) to 71.8 (R2). A nice practical touch: an episode-end prediction head reduces “post-success fidgeting” that can flip successes into failures.

      "abstract": "Current repository agents encounter a reasoning disconnect due to fragmented representations, as existing methods rely on isolated API documentation or dependency graphs that lack semantic depth. We consider repository comprehension and generation to be inverse processes within a unified cycle: generation expands intent into implementation, while comprehension compresses implementation back into intent. To address this, we propose RPG-Encoder, a framework that generalizes the Repository Planning Graph (RPG) from a static generative blueprint into a unified, high-fidelity representation. RPG-Encoder closes the reasoning loop through three mechanisms: (1) Encoding raw code into the RPG that combines lifted semantic features with code dependencies; (2) Evolving the topology incrementally to decouple maintenance costs from repository scale, reducing overhead by 95.7%; and (3) Operating as a unified interface for structure-aware navigation. In evaluations, RPG-Encoder establishes state-of-the-art repository understanding on SWE-bench Verified with 93.7% Acc@5 and exceeds the best baseline by over 10% on SWE-bench Live Lite. These results highlight our superior fine-grained localization accuracy in complex codebases. Furthermore, it achieves 98.5% reconstruction coverage on RepoCraft, confirming RPG’s high-fidelity capacity to mirror the original codebase and closing the loop between intent and implementation.",

      "abstract": "Pixel diffusion generates images directly in pixel space in an end-to-end manner, avoiding the artifacts and bottlenecks introduced by VAEs in two-stage latent diffusion. However, it is challenging to optimize high-dimensional pixel manifolds that contain many perceptually irrelevant signals, leaving existing pixel diffusion methods lagging behind latent diffusion models. We propose PixelGen, a simple pixel diffusion framework with perceptual supervision. Instead of modeling the full image manifold, PixelGen introduces two complementary perceptual losses to guide diffusion model towards learning a more meaningful perceptual manifold. An LPIPS loss facilitates learning better local patterns, while a DINO-based perceptual loss strengthens global semantics. With perceptual supervision, PixelGen surpasses strong latent diffusion baselines. It achieves an FID of 5.11 on ImageNet-256 without classifier-free guidance using only 80 training epochs, and demonstrates favorable scaling performance on large-scale text-to-image generation with a GenEval score of 0.79. PixelGen requires no VAEs, no latent representations, and no auxiliary stages, providing a simpler yet more powerful generative paradigm.

But when this supervised stage is followed by an online RL stage,  SFT stage gains may not be preserved after online RL .  This paper experiments with a variety of supervised objectives, and finds that the out-of-the-box performance of these objectives often change after subsequent RL. This highlights a mismatch between these two goals. This paper proposes a reweighing mechanism for standard supervised losses designed to weigh each token using the effect of learning on that token on RL stage.

      "abstract": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable success in open-vocabulary perceptual tasks, yet their ability to solve complex cognitive problems remains limited, especially when visual details are abstract and require visual memory. Current approaches primarily scale Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in the text space, even when language alone is insufficient for clear and structured reasoning, and largely neglect visual reasoning mechanisms analogous to the human visuospatial sketchpad and visual imagery. To mitigate this deficiency, we introduce Cognitive Supersensing, a novel training paradigm that endows MLLMs with human-like visual imagery capabilities by integrating a Latent Visual Imagery Prediction (LVIP) head that jointly learns sequences of visual cognitive latent embeddings and aligns them with the answer, thereby forming vision-based internal reasoning chains. We further introduce a reinforcement learning stage that optimizes text reasoning paths based on this grounded visual latent. To evaluate the cognitive capabilities of MLLMs, we present CogSense-Bench, a comprehensive visual question answering (VQA) benchmark assessing five cognitive dimensions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MLLMs trained with Cognitive Supersensing significantly outperform state-of-the-art baselines on CogSense-Bench and exhibit superior generalization on out-of-domain mathematics and science VQA benchmarks, suggesting that internal visual imagery is potentially key to bridging the gap between perceptual recognition and cognitive understanding. We will open-source the CogSense-Bench and our model weights.",

We evaluate a diverse set of open-source and proprietary LLMs spanning general-purpose, Japanese-adapted, and financial models. Results show that even state-of-the-art systems struggle on both tasks. While increased model scale yields limited improvements, language- and domain-specific adaptation does not reliably improve performance, leaving substantial gaps unresolved.

      "abstract": "Progressive Learning (PL) reduces pre-training computational overhead by gradually increasing model scale. While prior work has extensively explored depth expansion, width expansion remains significantly understudied, with the few existing methods limited to the early stages of training. However, expanding width during the mid-stage is essential for maximizing computational savings, yet it remains a formidable challenge due to severe training instabilities. Empirically, we show that naive initialization at this stage disrupts activation statistics, triggering loss spikes, while copy-based initialization introduces gradient symmetry that hinders feature diversity. To address these issues, we propose SPARKLING (balancing Signal Preservation And symmetRy breaKing for width-progressive LearnING), a novel framework for mid-stage width expansion. Our method achieves signal preservation via RMS-scale consistency, stabilizing activation statistics during expansion. Symmetry breaking is ensured through asymmetric optimizer state resetting and learning rate re-warmup. Extensive experiments on Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models demonstrate that, across multiple width axes and optimizer families, SPARKLING consistently outperforms training from scratch and reduces training cost by up to 35% under 2× width expansion.",

However, existing agentic systems remain difficult to scale and lag behind human performance. A key limitation is the absence of reusable and structured skill abstractions that capture how humans interact with graphical user interfaces and how to leverage these skills. We introduce CUA-Skill, a computer-using agentic skill base that encodes human computer-use knowledge as skills coupled with parameterized execution and composition graphs. CUA-Skill is a large-scale library of carefully engineered skills spanning common Windows applications, serving as a practical infrastructure and tool substrate for scalable, reliable agent development. Built upon this skill base, we construct CUA-Skill Agent, an end-to-end computer-using agent that supports dynamic skill retrieval, argument instantiation, and memory-aware failure recovery. Our results demonstrate that CUA-Skill substantially improves execution success rates and robustness on challenging end-to-end agent benchmarks, establishing a strong foundation for future computer-using agent development. On WindowsAgentArena, CUA-Skill Agent achieves state-of-the-art 57.5% (best of three) successful rate while being significantly more efficient than prior and concurrent approaches.

      "abstract": "PolySAE: Modeling Feature Interactions via Polynomial Decoding What: We generalize Sparse Autoencoders to capture feature interactions via polynomial decoding while preserving linear, interpretable encodings. Why: Standard SAEs assume features combine additively through linear reconstruction, which conflates compositional concepts with co-occurrence—they can't distinguish whether \"Starbucks\" emerges from composing \"star\" + \"coffee\" features or merely their frequent overlap, forcing monolithic features for compound concepts. How: We extend the decoder with quadratic and cubic terms to model interactions while preserving the linear encoder essential for interpretability. Through low-rank tensor factorization, PolySAE captures pairwise and triple feature interactions with minimal parameter overhead (~3% on GPT-2 Small). Results: Across 4 LLMs and 3 sparsifiers, we achieve an average 8% improvement in probing F1 and 2–10× larger Wasserstein distances between class-conditional distributions, while maintaining comparable reconstruction error. Beyond Co-occurrence: Learned interaction weights show negligible correlation with co-occurrence frequency (r = 0.06 vs. r = 0.82 for SAE feature covariance), suggesting the model captures compositional semantics rather than surface statistics. Interpretable Interactions: Qualitative analysis reveals meaningful interaction patterns with examples \"invest\" + \"-ing\" + \"stock\" → financial contexts, \"star\" + \"coffee\" → Starbucks, or \"nuclear\" + \"test\" + \"radiation\" → weapons testing. Plug-and-Play: PolySAE is a strict generalization of standard SAEs—setting interaction coefficients to zero recovers vanilla behavior—and is compatible with SAE architectures (i.e., TopK, BatchTopK, Matryoshka, etc.).",

To address this limitation, we propose Rubric-ARM, a framework that jointly optimizes a rubric generator and a judge using reinforcement learning from preference feedback. Unlike existing methods that rely on static rubrics or disjoint training pipelines, our approach treats rubric generation as a latent action learned to maximize judgment accuracy. We introduce an alternating optimization strategy to mitigate the non-stationarity of simultaneous updates, providing theoretical analysis that demonstrates how this schedule reduces gradient variance during training. Extensive experiments show that Rubric-ARM achieves state-of-the-art performance among baselines on multiple benchmarks and significantly improves downstream policy alignment in both offline and online reinforcement learning settings.",

      "abstract": "The capacity of AI agents to effectively handle tasks of increasing duration and complexity continues to grow, demonstrating exceptional performance in coding, deep research, and complex problem-solving evaluations. However, in daily scenarios, the perception of these advanced AI capabilities among general users remains limited. We argue that current evaluations prioritize increasing task difficulty without sufficiently addressing the diversity of agentic tasks necessary to cover the daily work, life, and learning activities of a broad demographic. To address this, we propose AgentIF-OneDay, aimed at determining whether general users can utilize natural language instructions and AI agents to complete a diverse array of daily tasks. These tasks require not only solving problems through dialogue but also understanding various attachment types and delivering tangible file-based results. The benchmark is structured around three user-centric categories: Open Workflow Execution, which assesses adherence to explicit and complex workflows; Latent Instruction, which requires agents to infer implicit instructions from attachments; and Iterative Refinement, which involves modifying or expanding upon ongoing work. We employ instance-level rubrics and a refined evaluation pipeline that aligns LLM-based verification with human judgment, achieving an 80.1% agreement rate using Gemini-3-Pro. AgentIF-OneDay comprises 104 tasks covering 767 scoring points. We benchmarked four leading general AI agents and found that agent products built based on APIs and ChatGPT agents based on agent RL remain in the first tier simultaneously. Leading LLM APIs and open-source models have internalized agentic capabilities, enabling AI application teams to develop cutting-edge Agent products.",

However, existing automated question synthesis methods lack precise difficulty control, incur high computational costs, and struggle to generate competition-level questions at scale. In this paper, we propose CoDiQ (Controllable Difficult Question Generation), a novel framework enabling fine-grained difficulty control via test-time scaling while ensuring question solvability. Specifically, first, we identify a test-time scaling tendency (extended reasoning token budget boosts difficulty but reduces solvability) and the intrinsic properties defining the upper bound of a model's ability to generate valid, high-difficulty questions. Then, we develop CoDiQ-Generator from Qwen3-8B, which improves the upper bound of difficult question generation, making it particularly well-suited for challenging question construction. Building on the CoDiQ framework, we build CoDiQ-Corpus (44K competition-grade question sequences). Human evaluations show these questions are significantly more challenging than LiveCodeBench/AIME with over 82% solvability. Training LRMs on CoDiQ-Corpus substantially improves reasoning performance, verifying that scaling controlled-difficulty training questions enhances reasoning capabilities. We open-source CoDiQ-Corpus, CoDiQ-Generator, and implementations to support related research.",

      "abstract": "World models learn an internal representation of environment dynamics, enabling agents to simulate and reason about future states within a compact latent space for tasks such as planning, prediction, and inference. However, running world models rely on hevay computational cost and memory footprint, making model quantization essential for efficient deployment. To date, the effects of post-training quantization (PTQ) on world models remain largely unexamined. In this work, we present a systematic empirical study of world model quantization using DINO-WM as a representative case, evaluating diverse PTQ methods under both weight-only and joint weight-activation settings. We conduct extensive experiments on different visual planning tasks across a wide range of bit-widths, quantization granularities, and planning horizons up to 50 iterations. Our results show that quantization effects in world models extend beyond standard accuracy and bit-width trade-offs: group-wise weight quantization can stabilize low-bit rollouts, activation quantization granularity yields inconsistent benefits, and quantization sensitivity is highly asymmetric between encoder and predictor modules. Moreover, aggressive low-bit quantization significantly degrades the alignment between the planning objective and task success, leading to failures that cannot be remedied by additional optimization. These findings reveal distinct quantization-induced failure modes in world model-based planning and provide practical guidance for deploying quantized world models under strict computational constraints.

      "abstract": "This paper introduces Deep Data Research , shifting from executional intelligence , which focuses on completing assigned tasks, to investigatory intelligence , where agents autonomously set goals and explore. Under this paradigm, Agentic LLMs are allowed to explore databases freely, discovering insights behind the data, without any predefined queries, questions, or objectives. The LLM-generated insights are evaluated against a fact checklist derived from the freeform components of the database, which naturally yields an aligned and objective evaluation. Beyond presenting DDR-Bench, the paper's experimental analysis reveals some insights into investigatory intelligence: Inference-time Scaling Dynamics : Top models exhibit \"quality over quantity\". They delay commitment and concentrate reasoning into a few high-value late-stage interactions. Token scaling shows flat-then-sharp patterns where final-stage tokens deliver disproportionate value, signalling depth-first exploration after breadth-oriented search. Balanced Exploration Regime : Entropy-based visualisation reveals advanced models consistently operate in a balanced regime combining coverage with focus, supporting an \"implicit planning hypothesis\" where strong models maintain coherent exploration strategies without explicit scaffolding. Training Trumps Scaling : Analysis of the Qwen family shows parameter scaling alone yields marginal gains (under 3% from 10× parameters), and longer context windows don't consistently help. However, cross-generation models with agentic-first training, including targeted pre-training and reinforcement learning, achieve substantially higher ceilings despite fewer activated parameters, demonstrating that meaningful agency requires intentional training strategies over mere scale. Scaffolding Paradox : Adding sophisticated frameworks like reasoning or memory mechanisms leads to unpredictable behaviours and may degrade performance. Proactive versus reactive comparison shows substantial gaps, confirming that autonomous goal-setting demands far exceed executing predefined objectives. Failure Modes : 58% of errors stem from insufficient exploration breadth/depth, while 40% involve other issues: powerful models over-reason with unsupported assumptions, weaker models struggle with instruction-following.",

      "abstract": "Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) achieve strong performance on single-image tasks, but their performance declines when multiple images are provided as input. One major reason is the cross-image information leakage, where the model struggles to distinguish information across different images. Existing LVLMs already employ delimiter tokens to mark the start and end of each image, yet our analysis reveals that these tokens fail to effectively block cross-image information leakage. To enhance their effectiveness, we propose a method that scales the hidden states of delimiter tokens. This enhances the model's ability to preserve image-specific information by reinforcing intra-image interaction and limiting undesired cross-image interactions. Consequently, the model is better able to distinguish between images and reason over them more accurately. Experiments show performance gains on multi-image benchmarks such as Mantis, MuirBench, MIRB, and QBench2. We further evaluate our method on text-only tasks that require clear distinction. The method improves performance on multi-document and multi-table understanding benchmarks, including TQABench, MultiNews, and WCEP-10. Notably, our method requires no additional training or inference cost.",

Most test-time scaling (TTS) algorithms rely on autoregressive decoding, which is ill-suited to discrete diffusion language models (dLLMs) due to their parallel decoding over the entire sequence. As a result, developing effective and efficient TTS methods to unlock dLLMs' full generative potential remains an underexplored challenge. To address this, we propose Prism (Pruning, Remasking, and Integrated Self-verification Method), an efficient TTS framework for dLLMs that (i) performs Hierarchical Trajectory Search (HTS) which dynamically prunes and reallocates compute in an early-to-mid denoising window, (ii) introduces Local branching with partial remasking to explore diverse implementations while preserving high-confidence tokens, and (iii) replaces external verifiers with Self-Verified Feedback (SVF) obtained via self-evaluation prompts on intermediate completions. Across four mathematical reasoning and code generation benchmarks on three dLLMs, including LLaDA 8B Instruct, Dream 7B Instruct, and LLaDA 2.0-mini, our Prism achieves a favorable performance-efficiency trade-off, matching best-of-N performance with substantially fewer function evaluations (NFE).

With a small set of Estonian native speaker annotations as a reference point, we find systematic ranking instabilities: surface-level metrics (lexical diversity, surface and semantic similarity) maintain cross-language stability, but pragmatic judgments (coherence, instruction-following) exhibit rank inversions and near-zero correlations. Because generation is controlled, these inconsistencies reflect how judge scoring behaves differently across languages rather than true model differences. This controlled design provides a diagnostic probe: evaluation methods that fail to maintain stability under identical generation conditions signal transfer failure before deployment. Our findings suggest that zero-shot judge transfer is unreliable for discourse-level assessment in morphologically rich languages, motivating language-specific calibration against targeted human baselines. We release our controlled generation protocol, synthetic data, and evaluation framework to enable replication across language families at https://github.com/isaac-chung/ cross-lingual-stability-judges.",

This work introduces an automated data pipeline that mines high-purity single-event segments from unconstrained recordings and synthesizes mixtures using semantically consistent strategies, effectively reducing co-occurrence noise at the source. Based on this pipeline, the authors release Hive, a 2,000-hour high-quality synthetic dataset for data-efficient training. Despite using only ~0.2% of the data scale of million-hour baselines, models trained on Hive achieve competitive separation accuracy and perceptual quality, and show strong zero-shot generalization on out-of-distribution benchmarks such as MUSDB18-HQ and USS-Bench. The key takeaway is clear: prioritizing supervision purity can dramatically improve data efficiency, offering a practical path toward robust auditory foundation models with reduced compute and annotation costs.",

We introduce On-policy Verbal Distillation (OVD), a memory-efficient framework that replaces token-level probability matching with trajectory matching using discrete verbal scores (0–9) from teacher models. OVD dramatically reduces memory consumption while enabling on-policy distillation from teacher models with verbal feedback, and avoids token-level alignment, allowing the student model to freely explore the output space. Extensive experiments on Web question answering and mathematical reasoning tasks show that OVD substantially outperforms existing methods, delivering up to +12.9% absolute improvement in average EM on Web Q&A tasks and a up to +25.7% gain on math benchmarks (when trained with only one random samples), while also exhibiting superior training efficiency.

Research addressed: How has OpenAI's public discourse leveraged 'ethics', 'safety', 'alignment', and adjacent related concepts over time, and what does discourse signal about framing in practice? A structured corpus, differentiating between communication for a general audience and communication with an academic audience, was assembled from public documentation. Qualitative content analysis of ethical themes combined inductively derived and deductively applied codes. Quantitative analysis leveraged computational content analysis methods via NLP to model topics and quantify changes in rhetoric over time. Visualizations report aggregate results. Results indicate that safety and risk discourse dominate OpenAI's public communication and documentation, without applying academic and advocacy ethics frameworks or vocabularies. Implications for governance are presented, along with a discussion of ethics-washing practices in industry.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents YOLOE-26, a unified framework that integrates the deployment-optimized YOLO26(or YOLOv26) architecture with the open-vocabulary learning paradigm of YOLOE for real-time open-vocabulary instance segmentation. Building on the NMS-free, end-to-end design of YOLOv26, the proposed approach preserves the hallmark efficiency and determinism of the YOLO family while extending its capabilities beyond closed-set recognition. YOLOE-26 employs a convolutional backbone with PAN/FPN-style multi-scale feature aggregation, followed by end-to-end regression and instance segmentation heads. A key architecturAl contribution is the replacement of fixed class logits with an object embedding head, which formulates classification as similarity matching against prompt embeddings derived from text descriptions, visual examples, or a built-in vocabulary. To enable efficient open-vocabulary reasoning, the framework incorporates Re-Parameterizable Region-Text Alignment (RepRTA) for zero-overhead text prompting, a Semantic-Activated Visual Prompt Encoder (SAVPE) for example-guided segmentation, and Lazy Region Prompt Contrast for prompt-free inference. All prompting modalities operate within a unified object embedding space, allowing seamless switching between text-prompted, visual-prompted, and fully autonomous segmentation. Extensive experiments demonstrate consistent scaling behavior and favorable accuracy-efficiency trade-offs across model sizes in both prompted and prompt-free settings. The training strategy leverages large-scale detection and grounding datasets with multi-task optimization and remains fully compatible with the Ultralytics ecosystem for training, validation, and deployment. Overall, YOLOE-26 provides a practical and scalable solution for real-time open-vocabulary instance segmentation in dynamic, real-world environments.",

This abstraction decouples orchestration from execution, making the system plug-and-play across heterogeneous agent backends.

      "title": "daVinci-Agency: Unlocking Long-Horizon Agency Data-Efficiently",
      "abstract": "While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at short-term tasks, scaling them to long-horizon agentic workflows remains challenging. The core bottleneck lies in the scarcity of training data that captures authentic long-dependency structures and cross-stage evolutionary dynamics—existing synthesis methods either confine to single-feature scenarios constrained by model distribution, or incur prohibitive human annotation costs, failing to provide scalable, high-quality supervision. We address this by reconceptualizing data synthesis through the lens of real-world software evolution. Our key insight: Pull Request (PR) sequences naturally embody the supervision signals for long-horizon learning. They decompose complex objectives into verifiable submission units, maintain functional coherence across iterations, and encode authentic refinement patterns through bug-fix histories. Building on this, we propose daVinci-Agency , which systematically mines structured supervision from chain-of-PRs through three interlocking mechanisms: (1) progressive task decomposition via continuous commits, (2) long-term consistency enforcement through unified functional objectives, and (3) verifiable refinement from authentic bug-fix trajectories. Unlike synthetic trajectories that treat each step independently, daVinci-Agency's PR-grounded structure inherently preserves the causal dependencies and iterative refinements essential for teaching persistent goal-directed behavior and enables natural alignment with project-level, full-cycle task modeling. The resulting trajectories are substantial—averaging 85k tokens and 116 tool calls—yet remarkably data-efficient: fine-tuning GLM-4.6 on 239 daVinci-Agency samples yields broad improvements across benchmarks, notably achieving a 47% relative gain on Toolathlon. Beyond benchmark performance, our analysis confirms the model's effective internalization of long-horizon behaviors and unveils training and inference scaling laws specific to extended planning tasks. Our work establishes daVinci-Agency as a scalable paradigm that overcomes the limitations of single-feature synthesis, demonstrating that modeling real-world evolutionary trajectories offers a principled path to unlock the intrinsic long-horizon potential of agents.",

      "abstract": "Parallel thinking has emerged as a promising paradigm for reasoning, yet it imposes significant computational burdens. Existing efficiency methods primarily rely on local, per-trajectory signals and lack principled mechanisms to exploit global dynamics across parallel branches. We introduce 2D probing, an interface that exposes the width-depth dynamics of parallel thinking by periodically eliciting intermediate answers from all branches. Our analysis reveals three key insights: non-monotonic scaling across width-depth allocations, heterogeneous reasoning branch lengths, and early stabilization of global consensus. Guided by these insights, we introduce Parallel-Probe, a training-free controller designed to optimize online parallel thinking. Parallel-Probe employs consensus-based early stopping to regulate reasoning depth and deviation-based branch pruning to dynamically adjust width. Extensive experiments across three benchmarks and multiple models demonstrate that Parallel-Probe establishes a superior Pareto frontier for test-time scaling. Compared to standard majority voting, it reduces sequential tokens by up to 35.8% and total token cost by over 25.8% while maintaining competitive accuracy.",

      "abstract": "Nowadays, training and evaluating DeepResearch-generated reports remain challenging due to the lack of verifiable reward signals. Accordingly, rubric-based evaluation has become a common practice. However, existing approaches either rely on coarse, pre-defined rubrics that lack sufficient granularity, or depend on manually constructed query-specific rubrics that are costly and difficult to scale. In this paper, we propose a pipeline to train human-preference-aligned query-specific rubric generators tailored for DeepResearch report generation. We first construct a dataset of DeepResearch-style queries annotated with human preferences over paired reports, and train rubric generators via reinforcement learning with a hybrid reward combining human preference supervision and LLM-based rubric evaluation. To better handle long-horizon reasoning, we further introduce a Multi-agent Markov-state (MaMs) workflow for report generation. We empirically show that our proposed rubric generators deliver more discriminative and better human-aligned supervision than existing rubric design strategies. Moreover, when integrated into the MaMs training framework, DeepResearch systems equipped with our rubric generators consistently outperform all open-source baselines on the DeepResearch Bench and achieve performance comparable to that of leading closed-source models.",

      "abstract": "The Homotopy paradigm, a general principle for solving challenging problems, appears across diverse domains such as robust optimization, global optimization, polynomial root-finding, and sampling. Practical solvers for these problems typically follow a predictor-corrector (PC) structure, but rely on hand-crafted heuristics for step sizes and iteration termination, which are often suboptimal and task-specific. To address this, we unify these problems under a single framework, which enables the design of a general neural solver. Building on this unified view, we propose Neural Predictor-Corrector (NPC), which replaces hand-crafted heuristics with automatically learned policies. NPC formulates policy selection as a sequential decision-making problem and leverages reinforcement learning to automatically discover efficient strategies. To further enhance generalization, we introduce an amortized training mechanism, enabling one-time offline training for a class of problems and efficient online inference on new instances. Experiments on four representative homotopy problems demonstrate that our method generalizes effectively to unseen instances. It consistently outperforms classical and specialized baselines in efficiency while demonstrating superior stability across tasks, highlighting the value of unifying homotopy methods into a single neural framework.",

Second, we introduce WideSeek, a dynamic hierarchical multi-agent architecture that could autonomously fork parallel sub-agents based on task requirements.

      "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has shown strong promise for improving LLM reasoning, but in practice it often fails silently: for many hard prompts, all rollouts receive zero reward, causing training to stall or collapse. 🔍 Key observation Through token-level analysis, we find that many failed rollouts are not due to problem difficulty. Instead, failures are often caused by a very small number of “interference tokens” (<5%) that derail the entire reasoning trajectory. ✂️ Interference Token Purification Simply removing these high-interference tokens can: turn failed rollouts into successful ones improve rollout accuracy by 20%+ on previously zero-reward prompts 🚀 Method: Less Noise Sampling (LENS) We introduce LENS, an online selective rollout framework for RLVR: Identify & remove interference tokens in low-success prompts to unlock successful rollouts Transfer learning back to the original noisy prompts, using denoised rollouts as high-reward supervision → the model learns to ignore noise, not just solve cleaner prompts 📊 Results Pareto improvement over GRPO in performance–efficiency trade-offs +3.88% average accuracy gain across 7 math reasoning benchmarks 1.6× faster convergence with less compute Outperforms both rollout scaling and prompt filtering baselines 💡 Takeaway Low-success prompts are not useless—they contain valuable signals hidden behind a few noisy tokens. Pruning interference tokens offers a new perspective on improving exploration efficiency in RLVR. 🔗 Links Paper: Less Noise Sampling Framework for RLVR Keywords: RLVR, GRPO, reasoning, rollout efficiency, token-level analysis",

The Solution: ID-MoCQA uses a framework to turn simple facts into complex reasoning chains across six categories (like geography and tradition) in both English and Indonesian. The Finding: Current LLMs struggle significantly with these complex cultural inferences, highlighting a major gap in their \"cultural intelligence.\"",

      "title": "Bridging Online and Offline RL: Contextual Bandit Learning for Multi-Turn Code Generation",
      "abstract": "Recently, there have been significant research interests in training large language models (LLMs) with reinforcement learning (RL) on real-world tasks, such as multi-turn code generation. While online RL tends to perform better than offline RL, its higher training cost and instability hinders wide adoption. In this paper, we build on the observation that multi-turn code generation can be formulated as a one-step recoverable Markov decision process and propose contextual bandit learning with offline trajectories (Cobalt), a new method that combines the benefits of online and offline RL. Cobalt first collects code generation trajectories using a reference LLM and divides them into partial trajectories as contextual prompts. Then, during online bandit learning, the LLM is trained to complete each partial trajectory prompt through single-step code generation. Cobalt outperforms two multi-turn online RL baselines based on GRPO and VeRPO, and substantially improves R1-Distill 8B and Qwen3 8B by up to 9.0 and 6.2 absolute Pass@1 scores on LiveCodeBench. Also, we analyze LLMs' in-context reward hacking behaviors and augment Cobalt training with perturbed trajectories to mitigate this issue. Overall, our results demonstrate Cobalt as a promising solution for iterative decision-making tasks like multi-turn code generation.

It converts recent, expert-validated scientific insights from top ML conferences into masked discovery challenges, forcing agents to rediscover human-verified insights rather than reproduce methods. By anchoring open-ended exploration to human-grounded ground truth and evaluating discovery at the claim level, FIRE-Bench reveals a clear “science gap”: today’s best agents are less capable (<50 F1), unreliable, and fail mainly at planning and reasoning, not coding. The benchmark offers a scalable, structured way to convert a paper into a constrained discovery problem to measure progress toward reliable, creative, full-cycle scientific discovery, and targets a path toward live, continuously updated evaluation of research-capable AI.",

      "abstract": "With the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), general-purpose agents have seen fundamental advancements. However, evaluating these agents presents unique challenges that distinguish them from static QA benchmarks. We observe that current agent benchmarks are heavily confounded by extraneous factors, including system prompts, toolset configurations, and environmental dynamics. Existing evaluations often rely on fragmented, researcher-specific frameworks where the prompt engineering for reasoning and tool usage varies significantly, making it difficult to attribute performance gains to the model itself. Additionally, the lack of standardized environmental data leads to untraceable errors and non-reproducible results. This lack of standardization introduces substantial unfairness and opacity into the field. We propose that a unified evaluation framework is essential for the rigorous advancement of agent evaluation. To this end, we introduce a proposal aimed at standardizing agent evaluation.",

      "abstract": "Improving the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) typically relies either on the model's ability to sample a correct solution to be reinforced or on the existence of a stronger model able to solve the problem. However, many difficult problems remain intractable for even current frontier models, preventing the extraction of valid training signals. A promising alternative is to leverage high-quality expert human solutions, yet naive imitation of this data fails because it is fundamentally out of distribution: expert solutions are typically didactic, containing implicit reasoning gaps intended for human readers rather than computational models. Furthermore, high-quality expert solutions are expensive, necessitating generalizable sample-efficient training methods. We propose Distribution Aligned Imitation Learning (DAIL), a two-step method that bridges the distributional gap by first transforming expert solutions into detailed, in-distribution reasoning traces and then applying a contrastive objective to focus learning on expert insights and methodologies. We find that DAIL can leverage fewer than 1000 high-quality expert solutions to achieve 10-25% pass@k gains on Qwen2.5-Instruct and Qwen3 models, improve reasoning efficiency by 2x to 4x, and enable out-of-domain generalization.",

      "abstract": "Multimodal Process Reward Models (MPRMs) are central to step-level supervision for visual reasoning in MLLMs. Training MPRMs typically requires large-scale Monte Carlo (MC)-annotated corpora, incurring substantial training cost. This paper studies the data efficiency for MPRM training. Our preliminary experiments reveal that MPRM training quickly saturates under random subsampling of the training data, indicating substantial redundancy within existing MC-annotated corpora. To explain this, we formalize a theoretical framework and reveal that informative gradient updates depend on two factors: label mixtures of positive/negative steps and label reliability (average MC scores of positive steps). Guided by these insights, we propose the Balanced-Information Score (BIS), which prioritizes both mixture and reliability based on existing MC signals at the rollout level, without incurring any additional cost. Across two backbones (InternVL2.5-8B and Qwen2.5-VL-7B) on VisualProcessBench, BIS-selected subsets consistently match and even surpass the full-data performance at small fractions. Notably, the BIS subset reaches full-data performance using only 10% of the training data, improving over random subsampling by a relative 4.1%. Our code is released Balanced-Info-MPRM .",

      "abstract": "Recent DiT-based text-to-image models increasingly adopt LLMs as text encoders, yet text conditioning remains largely static and often utilizes only a single LLM layer, despite pronounced semantic hierarchy across LLM layers and non-stationary denoising dynamics over both diffusion time and network depth. To better match the dynamic process of DiT generation and thereby enhance the diffusion model's generative capability, we introduce a unified normalized convex fusion framework equipped with lightweight gates to systematically organize multi-layer LLM hidden states via time-wise, depth-wise, and joint fusion. Experiments establish Depth-wise Semantic Routing as the superior conditioning strategy, consistently improving text–image alignment and compositional generation (e.g., +9.97 on the GenAI-Bench Counting task). Conversely, we find that purely time-wise fusion can paradoxically degrade visual generation fidelity. We attribute this to a train–inference trajectory mismatch: under classifier-free guidance, nominal timesteps fail to track the effective SNR, causing semantically mistimed feature injection during inference. Overall, our results position depth-wise routing as a strong and effective baseline and highlight the critical need for trajectory-aware signals to enable robust time-dependent conditioning.",

      "abstract": "For the past decade, the trajectory of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has been dominated by a model-centric paradigm driven by scaling laws. Despite significant leaps in visual fidelity, this approach has encountered a “usability ceiling” manifested as the Intent-Execution Gap (i.e., the fundamental disparity between a creator’s high-level intent and the stochastic, black-box nature of current single-shot models). In this paper, inspired by the Vibe Coding, we introduce the Vibe AIGC, a new paradigm for content generation via agentic orchestration, which represents the autonomous synthesis of hierarchical multi-agent workflows. Under this paradigm, the user’s role transcends traditional prompt engineering, evolving into a Commander who provides a Vibe, a high-level representation encompassing aesthetic preferences, functional logic, and etc. A centralized Meta- Planner then functions as a system architect, deconstructing this “Vibe” into executable, verifiable, and adaptive agentic pipelines. By transitioning from stochastic inference to logical orchestration, Vibe AIGC bridges the gap between human imagination and machine execution. We contend that this shift will redefine the human-AI collaborative economy, transforming AI from a fragile inference engine into a robust system-level engineering partner that democratizes the creation of complex, long-horizon digital assets.",

      "title": "VLS: Steering Pretrained Robot Policies via Vision-Language Models",
      "abstract": "Why do pretrained diffusion or flow-matching policies fail when the same task is performed near an obstacle, on a shifted support surface, or amid mild clutter? Such failures rarely reflect missing motor skills; instead, they expose a limitation of imitation learning under train-test shifts, where action generation is tightly coupled to training-specific spatial configurations and task specifications. Retraining or fine-tuning to address these failures is costly and conceptually misaligned, as the required behaviors already exist but cannot be selectively adapted at test time. We propose Vision-Language Steering (VLS), a training-free framework for inference-time adaptation of frozen generative robot policies. VLS treats adaptation as an inference-time control problem, steering the sampling process of a pretrained diffusion or flow-matching policy in response to out-of-distribution observation-language inputs without modifying policy parameters. By leveraging vision-language models to synthesize trajectory-differentiable reward functions, VLS guides denoising toward action trajectories that satisfy test-time spatial and task requirements. Across simulation and real-world evaluations, VLS consistently outperforms prior steering methods, achieving a 31% improvement on CALVIN and a 13% gain on LIBERO-PRO. Real-world deployment on a Franka robot further demonstrates robust inference-time adaptation under test-time spatial and semantic shifts.",

We introduce BatCoder, a self-supervised reinforcement learning framework designed to jointly optimize code generation and documentation production. BatCoder employs a back-translation strategy: a documentation is first generated from code, and then the generated documentation is used to reconstruct the original code. The semantic similarity between the original and reconstructed code serves as an implicit reward, enabling reinforcement learning to improve the model's performance both in generating code from documentation and vice versa. This approach allows models to be trained using only code, substantially increasing the available training examples. Evaluated on HumanEval and MBPP with a 7B model, BatCoder achieved 83.5% and 81.0% pass@1, outperforming strong open-source baselines. Moreover, the framework demonstrates consistent scaling with respect to both training corpus size and model capacity.",

      "abstract": "Current approaches to LLM safety fundamentally rely on a brittle cat-and-mouse game of identifying and blocking known threats via guardrails. We argue for a fresh approach: robust safety comes not from enumerating what is harmful, but from deeply understanding what is safe. We introduce Trust The Typical (T3), a framework that operationalizes this principle by treating safety as an out-of-distribution (OOD) detection problem. T3 learns the distribution of acceptable prompts in a semantic space and flags any significant deviation as a potential threat. Unlike prior methods, it requires no training on harmful examples, yet achieves state-of-the-art performance across 18 benchmarks spanning toxicity, hate speech, jailbreaking, multilingual harms, and over-refusal, reducing false positive rates by up to 40x relative to specialized safety models. A single model trained only on safe English text transfers effectively to diverse domains and over 14 languages without retraining. Finally, we demonstrate production readiness by integrating a GPU-optimized version into vLLM, enabling continuous guardrailing during token generation with less than 6% overhead even under dense evaluation intervals on large-scale workloads.",

      "title": "Reward-free Alignment for Conflicting Objectives",
      "abstract": "Direct alignment methods are increasingly used to align large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. However, many real-world alignment problems involve multiple conflicting objectives, where naive aggregation of preferences can lead to unstable training and poor trade-offs. In particular, weighted loss methods may fail to identify update directions that simultaneously improve all objectives, and existing multi-objective approaches often rely on explicit reward models, introducing additional complexity and distorting user-specified preferences. The contributions of this paper are two-fold. First, we propose a Reward-free Alignment framework for Conflicted Objectives (RACO) that directly leverages pairwise preference data and resolves gradient conflicts via a novel clipped variant of conflict-averse gradient descent. We provide convergence guarantees to Pareto-critical points that respect user-specified objective weights, and further show that clipping can strictly improve convergence rate in the two-objective setting. Second, we improve our method using some heuristics and conduct experiments to demonstrate the compatibility of the proposed framework for LLM alignment. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations on multi-objective summarization and safety alignment tasks across multiple LLM families (Qwen 3, Llama 3, Gemma 3) show that our method consistently achieves better Pareto trade-offs compared to existing multi-objective alignment baselines.",

      "abstract": "Most Large Language Model (LLM) agent memory systems rely on a small set of static, hand-designed operations for extracting memory. These fixed procedures hard-code human priors about what to store and how to revise memory, making them rigid under diverse interaction patterns and inefficient on long histories. To this end, we present \\textbf{MemSkill}, which reframes these operations as learnable and evolvable memory skills, structured and reusable routines for extracting, consolidating, and pruning information from interaction traces. Inspired by the design philosophy of agent skills, MemSkill employs a \\emph{controller} that learns to select a small set of relevant skills, paired with an LLM-based \\emph{executor} that produces skill-guided memories. Beyond learning skill selection, MemSkill introduces a \\emph{designer} that periodically reviews hard cases where selected skills yield incorrect or incomplete memories, and evolves the skill set by proposing refinements and new skills. Together, MemSkill forms a closed-loop procedure that improves both the skill-selection policy and the skill set itself. Experiments on LoCoMo, LongMemEval, HotpotQA, and ALFWorld demonstrate that MemSkill improves task performance over strong baselines and generalizes well across settings. Further analyses shed light on how skills evolve, offering insights toward more adaptive, self-evolving memory management for LLM agents.

      "abstract": "High-quality kernel is critical for scalable AI systems, and enabling LLMs to generate such code would advance AI development. However, training LLMs for this task requires sufficient data, a robust environment, and the process is often vulnerable to reward hacking and lazy optimization. In these cases, models may hack training rewards and prioritize trivial correctness over meaningful speedup. In this paper, we systematically study reinforcement learning (RL) for kernel generation. We first design KernelGYM, a robust distributed GPU environment that supports reward hacking check, data collection from multi-turn interactions and long-term RL training. Building on KernelGYM , we investigate effective multi-turn RL methods and identify a biased policy gradient issue caused by self-inclusion in GRPO. To solve this, we propose Turn-level Reinforce-Leave-One-Out ( TRLOO ) to provide unbiased advantage estimation for multi-turn RL. To alleviate lazy optimization, we incorporate mismatch correction for training stability and introduce Profiling-based Rewards ( PR ) and Profiling-based Rejection Sampling ( PRS ) to overcome the issue. The trained model, this Dr. Kernel-14B, reaches performance competitive with Claude-4.5-Sonnet in Kernelbench. Finally, we study sequential test-time scaling for this Dr. Kernel-14B. On the KernelBench Level-2 subset, 31.6% of the generated kernels achieve at least a 1.2x speedup over the Torch reference, surpassing Claude-4.5-Sonnet (26.7%) and GPT-5 (28.6%). When selecting the best candidate across all turns, this 1.2x speedup rate further increases to 47.8%.

      "abstract": "Training-time privileged information (PI) can enable language models to succeed on tasks they would otherwise fail, making it a powerful tool for reinforcement learning in hard, long-horizon settings. However, transferring capabilities learned with PI to policies that must act without it at inference time remains a fundamental challenge. We study this problem in the context of distilling frontier models for multi-turn agentic environments, where closed-source systems typically hide their internal reasoning and expose only action trajectories. This breaks standard distillation pipelines, since successful behavior is observable but the reasoning process is not. For this, we introduce {\\pi}-Distill, a joint teacher-student objective that trains a PI-conditioned teacher and an unconditioned student simultaneously using the same model. Additionally, we also introduce On-Policy Self-Distillation (OPSD), an alternative approach that trains using Reinforcement Learning (RL) with a reverse KL-penalty between the student and the PI-conditioned teacher. We show that both of these algorithms effectively distill frontier agents using action-only PI. Specifically we find that {\\pi}-Distill and in some cases OPSD, outperform industry standard practices (Supervised finetuning followed by RL) that assume access to full Chain-of-Thought supervision across multiple agentic benchmarks, models, and forms of PI. We complement our results with extensive analysis that characterizes the factors enabling effective learning with PI, focusing primarily on {\\pi}-Distill and characterizing when OPSD is competitive.",

      "abstract": "As Large Language Models increasingly automate complex, long-horizon tasks such as \\emph{vibe coding}, a supervision gap has emerged. While models excel at execution, users often struggle to guide them effectively due to insufficient domain expertise, the difficulty of articulating precise intent, and the inability to reliably validate complex outputs. It presents a critical challenge in scalable oversight: enabling humans to responsibly steer AI systems on tasks that surpass their own ability to specify or verify. To tackle this, we propose Scalable Interactive Oversight, a framework that decomposes complex intent into a recursive tree of manageable decisions to amplify human supervision. Rather than relying on open-ended prompting, our system elicits low-burden feedback at each node and recursively aggregates these signals into precise global guidance. Validated in web development task, our framework enables non-experts to produce expert-level Product Requirement Documents, achieving a 54% improvement in alignment. Crucially, we demonstrate that this framework can be optimized via Reinforcement Learning using only online user feedback, offering a practical pathway for maintaining human control as AI scales.",

      "abstract": "Despite strong performance on existing benchmarks, it remains unclear whether large language models can reason over genuinely novel scientific information. Most evaluations score end-to-end RAG pipelines, where reasoning is confounded with retrieval and toolchain choices, and the signal is further contaminated by parametric memorization and open-web volatility. We introduce DeR2, a controlled deep-research sandbox that isolates document-grounded reasoning while preserving core difficulties of deep search: multi-step synthesis, denoising, and evidence-based conclusion making. DeR2 decouples evidence access from reasoning via four regimes--Instruction-only, Concepts (gold concepts without documents), Related-only (only relevant documents), and Full-set (relevant documents plus topically related distractors)--yielding interpretable regime gaps that operationalize retrieval loss vs. reasoning loss and enable fine-grained error attribution. To prevent parametric leakage, we apply a two-phase validation that requires parametric failure without evidence while ensuring oracle-concept solvability. To ensure reproducibility, each instance provides a frozen document library (drawn from 2023-2025 theoretical papers) with expert-annotated concepts and validated rationales. Experiments across a diverse set of state-of-the-art foundation models reveal substantial variation and significant headroom: some models exhibit mode-switch fragility, performing worse with the Full-set than with Instruction-only, while others show structural concept misuse, correctly naming concepts but failing to execute them as procedures.",

While recent methods often rely on heuristic approaches to balance efficiency and quality, the fundamental relationship between original and synthetic data remains underexplored.

We introduce the concepts of Informativeness and Utility, capturing crucial information within a sample and essential samples in the training set, respectively. Building on these principles, we define optimal dataset distillation mathematically. We then present InfoUtil, a framework that balances informativeness and utility in synthesizing the distilled dataset. InfoUtil incorporates two key components: (1) game-theoretic informativeness maximization using Shapley Value attribution to extract key information from samples, and (2) principled utility maximization by selecting globally influential samples based on Gradient Norm. These components ensure that the distilled dataset is both informative and utility-optimized. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves a 6.1% performance improvement over the previous state-of-the-art approach on ImageNet-1K dataset using ResNet-18.",

However, in agentic settings, LLMs often struggle to anticipate action consequences and adapt to environment dynamics, highlighting the need for world-modeling capabilities in LLM-based agents. We propose Reinforcement World Model Learning (RWML), a self-supervised method that learns action-conditioned world models for LLM-based agents on textual states using sim-to-real gap rewards. Our method aligns simulated next states produced by the model with realized next states observed from the environment, encouraging consistency between internal world simulations and actual environment dynamics in a pre-trained embedding space. Unlike next-state token prediction, which prioritizes token-level fidelity (i.e., reproducing exact wording) over semantic equivalence and can lead to model collapse, our method provides a more robust training signal and is empirically less susceptible to reward hacking than LLM-as-a-judge. We evaluate our method on ALFWorld and τ2 Bench and observe significant gains over the base model, despite being entirely self-supervised. When combined with task-success rewards, our method outperforms direct task-success reward RL by 6.9 and 5.7 points on ALFWorld and τ2 Bench respectively, while matching the performance of expert-data training.",

      "abstract": "Deep research agents have emerged as powerful systems for addressing complex queries. Meanwhile, LLM-based retrievers have demonstrated strong capability in following instructions or reasoning. This raises a critical question: can LLM-based retrievers effectively contribute to deep research agent workflows? To investigate this, we introduce SAGE, a benchmark for scientific literature retrieval comprising 1,200 queries across four scientific domains, with a 200,000-paper retrieval corpus. We evaluate six deep research agents and find that all systems struggle with reasoning-intensive retrieval. Using DR Tulu as backbone, we further compare BM25 and LLM-based retrievers (i.e. ReasonIR and gte-Qwen2-7B-instruct) as alternative search tools. Surprisingly, BM25 significantly outperforms LLM-based retrievers by approximately 30%, as existing agents generate keyword-oriented sub-queries. To improve performance, we propose a corpus-level test-time scaling framework that uses LLMs to augment documents with metadata and keywords, making retrieval easier for off-the-shelf retrievers. This yields 8% and 2% gains on short-form and open-ended questions, respectively.",

      "abstract": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have recently been applied to universal multimodal retrieval, where Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning improves candidate reranking. However, existing approaches remain largely language-driven, relying on static visual encodings and lacking the ability to actively verify fine-grained visual evidence, which often leads to speculative reasoning in visually ambiguous cases. We propose V-Retrver, an evidence-driven retrieval framework that reformulates multimodal retrieval as an agentic reasoning process grounded in visual inspection. V-Retrver enables an MLLM to selectively acquire visual evidence during reasoning via external visual tools, performing a multimodal interleaved reasoning process that alternates between hypothesis generation and targeted visual verification.To train such an evidence-gathering retrieval agent, we adopt a curriculum-based learning strategy combining supervised reasoning activation, rejection-based refinement, and reinforcement learning with an evidence-aligned objective. Experiments across multiple multimodal retrieval benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements in retrieval accuracy (with 23.0% improvements on average), perception-driven reasoning reliability, and generalization.",

      "abstract": "This paper addresses a fundamental limitation in graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, which we characterize as the \"Static Graph Fallacy.\" While recent methods have successfully utilized Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to capture multi-hop dependencies, the reliance on fixed transition probabilities often results in semantic drift, where retrieval is diverted toward high-degree \"hub\" nodes rather than relevant evidence. CatRAG introduces a context-aware traversal framework that transforms the static KG into a query-adaptive navigation structure. By integrating symbolic anchoring and dynamic edge weighting, the system effectively prunes irrelevant paths and amplifies those aligned with the query’s specific intent. A key finding of our work is that while standard recall metrics show modest gains, there is a significant improvement in \"reasoning completeness\"—the ability to recover the entire evidence chain without gaps. This shift from partial context retrieval to grounded reasoning paths is a necessary step for robust multi-hop RAG. We look forward to discussing the implications of dynamic graph steering and how these techniques might scale to increasingly large and heterogeneous knowledge structures.",

To make it faster, we stack the blocks extracted from the preconditioners to obtain a 3D tensor, which are inverted efficiently using batch-matmuls via iterative procedures. To make it more accurate, we introduce an existing iterative method from Numerical Linear Algebra called Newton-DB, which is more accurate than the existing Coupled Newton implemented in Distributed Shampoo. These iterative procedures usually require the largest eigen-value of the input matrix to be upper bounded by 1, which should be obtained by scaling the input matrix. In theory, one should divide by the true largest eigen-value of the matrix, which is expensive to compute in Distributed Shampoo. Before our work, the simplest scaling was Frobenius norm, which is usually much larger than the largest eigen-value. Since we work with all blocks in parallel in a stacked form, our implementation allows running Power-Iteration to estimate the largest eigen-value for all blocks in one shot. Why is this better? When we scale the input matrix by Frobenius norm, the spectrum is shifted towards zero. We show that iterative procedures require more steps to converge for small eigen-values compared to larger ones. Therefore, scaling by an approximation of the largest eigen-value is desired and in our DASH implementation this is cheaper and therefore leads to faster training and more accurate models.

      "abstract": "Adaptive 1D Video Diffusion Autoencoder Recent video generation models largely rely on video autoencoders that compress pixel-space videos into latent representations. However, existing video autoencoders suffer from three major limitations: (1) fixed-rate compression that wastes tokens on simple videos, (2) inflexible CNN architectures that prevent variable-length latent modeling, and (3) deterministic decoders that struggle to recover appropriate details from compressed latents. To address these issues, we propose One-Dimensional Diffusion Video Autoencoder (One-DVA), a transformer-based framework for adaptive 1D encoding and diffusion-based decoding. The encoder employs query-based vision transformers to extract spatiotemporal features and produce latent representations, while a variable-length dropout mechanism dynamically adjusts the latent length. The decoder is a pixel-space diffusion transformer that reconstructs videos with the latents as input conditions. With a two-stage training strategy, One-DVA achieves performance comparable to 3D-CNN VAEs on reconstruction metrics at identical compression ratios. More importantly, it supports adaptive compression and thus can achieve higher compression ratios. To better support downstream latent generation, we further regularize the One-DVA latent distribution for generative modeling and fine-tune its decoder to mitigate artifacts caused by the generation process.",

We propose PhysicsAgentABM, which shifts inference to behaviorally coherent agent clusters: state-specialized symbolic agents encode mechanistic transition priors, a multimodal neural transition model captures temporal and interaction dynamics, and uncertainty-aware epistemic fusion yields calibrated cluster-level transition distributions. Individual agents then stochastically realize transitions under local constraints, decoupling population inference from entity-level variability. We further introduce ANCHOR, an LLM agent-driven clustering strategy based on cross-contextual behavioral responses and a novel contrastive loss, reducing LLM calls by up to 6-8 times. Experiments across public health, finance, and social sciences show consistent gains in event-time accuracy and calibration over mechanistic, neural, and LLM baselines. By re-architecting generative ABM around population-level inference with uncertainty-aware neuro-symbolic fusion, PhysicsAgentABM establishes a new paradigm for scalable and calibrated simulation with LLMs.",

However, the considerable computational cost of bidirectional full attention limits the inference efficiency. Although sparse attention is promising, existing methods remain ineffective. This stems from the need to estimate attention importance for tokens yet to be decoded, while the unmasked token positions are unknown during diffusion. In this paper, we present Focus-dLLM, a novel training-free attention sparsification framework tailored for accurate and efficient long-context dLLM inference. Based on the finding that token confidence strongly correlates across adjacent steps, we first design a past confidence-guided indicator to predict unmasked regions. Built upon this, we propose a sink-aware pruning strategy to accurately estimate and remove redundant attention computation, while preserving highly influential attention sinks. To further reduce overhead, this strategy reuses identified sink locations across layers, leveraging the observed cross-layer consistency. Experimental results show that our method offers more than 29× lossless speedup under 32K context length.",

      "abstract": "Most Large Language Model (LLM) agent memory systems rely on a small set of static, hand-designed operations for extracting memory. These fixed procedures hard-code human priors about what to store and how to revise memory, making them rigid under diverse interaction patterns and inefficient on long histories. To this end, we present \\textbf{MemSkill}, which reframes these operations as learnable and evolvable memory skills, structured and reusable routines for extracting, consolidating, and pruning information from interaction traces. Inspired by the design philosophy of agent skills, MemSkill employs a \\emph{controller} that learns to select a small set of relevant skills, paired with an LLM-based \\emph{executor} that produces skill-guided memories. Beyond learning skill selection, MemSkill introduces a \\emph{designer} that periodically reviews hard cases where selected skills yield incorrect or incomplete memories, and evolves the skill set by proposing refinements and new skills. Together, MemSkill forms a closed-loop procedure that improves both the skill-selection policy and the skill set itself. Experiments on LoCoMo, LongMemEval, HotpotQA, and ALFWorld demonstrate that MemSkill improves task performance over strong baselines and generalizes well across settings. Further analyses shed light on how skills evolve, offering insights toward more adaptive, self-evolving memory management for LLM agents.

      "abstract": "Training-time privileged information (PI) can enable language models to succeed on tasks they would otherwise fail, making it a powerful tool for reinforcement learning in hard, long-horizon settings. However, transferring capabilities learned with PI to policies that must act without it at inference time remains a fundamental challenge. We study this problem in the context of distilling frontier models for multi-turn agentic environments, where closed-source systems typically hide their internal reasoning and expose only action trajectories. This breaks standard distillation pipelines, since successful behavior is observable but the reasoning process is not. For this, we introduce {\\pi}-Distill, a joint teacher-student objective that trains a PI-conditioned teacher and an unconditioned student simultaneously using the same model. Additionally, we also introduce On-Policy Self-Distillation (OPSD), an alternative approach that trains using Reinforcement Learning (RL) with a reverse KL-penalty between the student and the PI-conditioned teacher. We show that both of these algorithms effectively distill frontier agents using action-only PI. Specifically we find that {\\pi}-Distill and in some cases OPSD, outperform industry standard practices (Supervised finetuning followed by RL) that assume access to full Chain-of-Thought supervision across multiple agentic benchmarks, models, and forms of PI. We complement our results with extensive analysis that characterizes the factors enabling effective learning with PI, focusing primarily on {\\pi}-Distill and characterizing when OPSD is competitive.",

      "abstract": "High-quality kernel is critical for scalable AI systems, and enabling LLMs to generate such code would advance AI development. However, training LLMs for this task requires sufficient data, a robust environment, and the process is often vulnerable to reward hacking and lazy optimization. In these cases, models may hack training rewards and prioritize trivial correctness over meaningful speedup. In this paper, we systematically study reinforcement learning (RL) for kernel generation. We first design KernelGYM, a robust distributed GPU environment that supports reward hacking check, data collection from multi-turn interactions and long-term RL training. Building on KernelGYM , we investigate effective multi-turn RL methods and identify a biased policy gradient issue caused by self-inclusion in GRPO. To solve this, we propose Turn-level Reinforce-Leave-One-Out ( TRLOO ) to provide unbiased advantage estimation for multi-turn RL. To alleviate lazy optimization, we incorporate mismatch correction for training stability and introduce Profiling-based Rewards ( PR ) and Profiling-based Rejection Sampling ( PRS ) to overcome the issue. The trained model, this Dr. Kernel-14B, reaches performance competitive with Claude-4.5-Sonnet in Kernelbench. Finally, we study sequential test-time scaling for this Dr. Kernel-14B. On the KernelBench Level-2 subset, 31.6% of the generated kernels achieve at least a 1.2x speedup over the Torch reference, surpassing Claude-4.5-Sonnet (26.7%) and GPT-5 (28.6%). When selecting the best candidate across all turns, this 1.2x speedup rate further increases to 47.8%.

      "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have achieved strong performance in language-centric tasks. However, in agentic settings, LLMs often struggle to anticipate action consequences and adapt to environment dynamics, highlighting the need for world-modeling capabilities in LLM-based agents. We propose Reinforcement World Model Learning (RWML), a self-supervised method that learns action-conditioned world models for LLM-based agents on textual states using sim-to-real gap rewards. Our method aligns simulated next states produced by the model with realized next states observed from the environment, encouraging consistency between internal world simulations and actual environment dynamics in a pre-trained embedding space. Unlike next-state token prediction, which prioritizes token-level fidelity (i.e., reproducing exact wording) over semantic equivalence and can lead to model collapse, our method provides a more robust training signal and is empirically less susceptible to reward hacking than LLM-as-a-judge. We evaluate our method on ALFWorld and τ2 Bench and observe significant gains over the base model, despite being entirely self-supervised. When combined with task-success rewards, our method outperforms direct task-success reward RL by 6.9 and 5.7 points on ALFWorld and τ2 Bench respectively, while matching the performance of expert-data training.",

      "abstract": "Despite strong performance on existing benchmarks, it remains unclear whether large language models can reason over genuinely novel scientific information. Most evaluations score end-to-end RAG pipelines, where reasoning is confounded with retrieval and toolchain choices, and the signal is further contaminated by parametric memorization and open-web volatility. We introduce DeR2, a controlled deep-research sandbox that isolates document-grounded reasoning while preserving core difficulties of deep search: multi-step synthesis, denoising, and evidence-based conclusion making. DeR2 decouples evidence access from reasoning via four regimes--Instruction-only, Concepts (gold concepts without documents), Related-only (only relevant documents), and Full-set (relevant documents plus topically related distractors)--yielding interpretable regime gaps that operationalize retrieval loss vs. reasoning loss and enable fine-grained error attribution. To prevent parametric leakage, we apply a two-phase validation that requires parametric failure without evidence while ensuring oracle-concept solvability. To ensure reproducibility, each instance provides a frozen document library (drawn from 2023-2025 theoretical papers) with expert-annotated concepts and validated rationales. Experiments across a diverse set of state-of-the-art foundation models reveal substantial variation and significant headroom: some models exhibit mode-switch fragility, performing worse with the Full-set than with Instruction-only, while others show structural concept misuse, correctly naming concepts but failing to execute them as procedures.",

      "abstract": "As Large Language Models increasingly automate complex, long-horizon tasks such as \\emph{vibe coding}, a supervision gap has emerged. While models excel at execution, users often struggle to guide them effectively due to insufficient domain expertise, the difficulty of articulating precise intent, and the inability to reliably validate complex outputs. It presents a critical challenge in scalable oversight: enabling humans to responsibly steer AI systems on tasks that surpass their own ability to specify or verify. To tackle this, we propose Scalable Interactive Oversight, a framework that decomposes complex intent into a recursive tree of manageable decisions to amplify human supervision. Rather than relying on open-ended prompting, our system elicits low-burden feedback at each node and recursively aggregates these signals into precise global guidance. Validated in web development task, our framework enables non-experts to produce expert-level Product Requirement Documents, achieving a 54% improvement in alignment. Crucially, we demonstrate that this framework can be optimized via Reinforcement Learning using only online user feedback, offering a practical pathway for maintaining human control as AI scales.",

While recent methods often rely on heuristic approaches to balance efficiency and quality, the fundamental relationship between original and synthetic data remains underexplored. This paper revisits knowledge distillation-based dataset distillation within a solid theoretical framework. We introduce the concepts of Informativeness and Utility, capturing crucial information within a sample and essential samples in the training set, respectively. Building on these principles, we define optimal dataset distillation mathematically. We then present InfoUtil, a framework that balances informativeness and utility in synthesizing the distilled dataset. InfoUtil incorporates two key components: (1) game-theoretic informativeness maximization using Shapley Value attribution to extract key information from samples, and (2) principled utility maximization by selecting globally influential samples based on Gradient Norm. These components ensure that the distilled dataset is both informative and utility-optimized. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves a 6.1% performance improvement over the previous state-of-the-art approach on ImageNet-1K dataset using ResNet-18.",

      "abstract": "Deep research agents have emerged as powerful systems for addressing complex queries. Meanwhile, LLM-based retrievers have demonstrated strong capability in following instructions or reasoning. This raises a critical question: can LLM-based retrievers effectively contribute to deep research agent workflows? To investigate this, we introduce SAGE, a benchmark for scientific literature retrieval comprising 1,200 queries across four scientific domains, with a 200,000-paper retrieval corpus. We evaluate six deep research agents and find that all systems struggle with reasoning-intensive retrieval. Using DR Tulu as backbone, we further compare BM25 and LLM-based retrievers (i.e. ReasonIR and gte-Qwen2-7B-instruct) as alternative search tools. Surprisingly, BM25 significantly outperforms LLM-based retrievers by approximately 30%, as existing agents generate keyword-oriented sub-queries. To improve performance, we propose a corpus-level test-time scaling framework that uses LLMs to augment documents with metadata and keywords, making retrieval easier for off-the-shelf retrievers. This yields 8% and 2% gains on short-form and open-ended questions, respectively.",

However, existing approaches remain largely language-driven, relying on static visual encodings and lacking the ability to actively verify fine-grained visual evidence, which often leads to speculative reasoning in visually ambiguous cases. We propose V-Retrver, an evidence-driven retrieval framework that reformulates multimodal retrieval as an agentic reasoning process grounded in visual inspection. V-Retrver enables an MLLM to selectively acquire visual evidence during reasoning via external visual tools, performing a multimodal interleaved reasoning process that alternates between hypothesis generation and targeted visual verification.To train such an evidence-gathering retrieval agent, we adopt a curriculum-based learning strategy combining supervised reasoning activation, rejection-based refinement, and reinforcement learning with an evidence-aligned objective. Experiments across multiple multimodal retrieval benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements in retrieval accuracy (with 23.0% improvements on average), perception-driven reasoning reliability, and generalization.",

      "abstract": "We propose DASH ( D istributed A ccelerated SH ampoo), a faster and more accurate version of Distributed Shampoo. To make it faster, we stack the blocks extracted from the preconditioners to obtain a 3D tensor, which are inverted efficiently using batch-matmuls via iterative procedures. To make it more accurate, we introduce an existing iterative method from Numerical Linear Algebra called Newton-DB, which is more accurate than the existing Coupled Newton implemented in Distributed Shampoo. These iterative procedures usually require the largest eigen-value of the input matrix to be upper bounded by 1, which should be obtained by scaling the input matrix. In theory, one should divide by the true largest eigen-value of the matrix, which is expensive to compute in Distributed Shampoo. Before our work, the simplest scaling was Frobenius norm, which is usually much larger than the largest eigen-value. Since we work with all blocks in parallel in a stacked form, our implementation allows running Power-Iteration to estimate the largest eigen-value for all blocks in one shot. Why is this better? When we scale the input matrix by Frobenius norm, the spectrum is shifted towards zero. We show that iterative procedures require more steps to converge for small eigen-values compared to larger ones. Therefore, scaling by an approximation of the largest eigen-value is desired and in our DASH implementation this is cheaper and therefore leads to faster training and more accurate models.

      "abstract": "This paper addresses a fundamental limitation in graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, which we characterize as the \"Static Graph Fallacy.\" While recent methods have successfully utilized Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to capture multi-hop dependencies, the reliance on fixed transition probabilities often results in semantic drift, where retrieval is diverted toward high-degree \"hub\" nodes rather than relevant evidence. CatRAG introduces a context-aware traversal framework that transforms the static KG into a query-adaptive navigation structure. By integrating symbolic anchoring and dynamic edge weighting, the system effectively prunes irrelevant paths and amplifies those aligned with the query’s specific intent. A key finding of our work is that while standard recall metrics show modest gains, there is a significant improvement in \"reasoning completeness\"—the ability to recover the entire evidence chain without gaps. This shift from partial context retrieval to grounded reasoning paths is a necessary step for robust multi-hop RAG. We look forward to discussing the implications of dynamic graph steering and how these techniques might scale to increasingly large and heterogeneous knowledge structures.",

      "abstract": "Adaptive 1D Video Diffusion Autoencoder Recent video generation models largely rely on video autoencoders that compress pixel-space videos into latent representations. However, existing video autoencoders suffer from three major limitations: (1) fixed-rate compression that wastes tokens on simple videos, (2) inflexible CNN architectures that prevent variable-length latent modeling, and (3) deterministic decoders that struggle to recover appropriate details from compressed latents. To address these issues, we propose One-Dimensional Diffusion Video Autoencoder (One-DVA), a transformer-based framework for adaptive 1D encoding and diffusion-based decoding. The encoder employs query-based vision transformers to extract spatiotemporal features and produce latent representations, while a variable-length dropout mechanism dynamically adjusts the latent length. The decoder is a pixel-space diffusion transformer that reconstructs videos with the latents as input conditions. With a two-stage training strategy, One-DVA achieves performance comparable to 3D-CNN VAEs on reconstruction metrics at identical compression ratios. More importantly, it supports adaptive compression and thus can achieve higher compression ratios. To better support downstream latent generation, we further regularize the One-DVA latent distribution for generative modeling and fine-tune its decoder to mitigate artifacts caused by the generation process.",

We propose PhysicsAgentABM, which shifts inference to behaviorally coherent agent clusters: state-specialized symbolic agents encode mechanistic transition priors, a multimodal neural transition model captures temporal and interaction dynamics, and uncertainty-aware epistemic fusion yields calibrated cluster-level transition distributions. Individual agents then stochastically realize transitions under local constraints, decoupling population inference from entity-level variability. We further introduce ANCHOR, an LLM agent-driven clustering strategy based on cross-contextual behavioral responses and a novel contrastive loss, reducing LLM calls by up to 6-8 times. Experiments across public health, finance, and social sciences show consistent gains in event-time accuracy and calibration over mechanistic, neural, and LLM baselines. By re-architecting generative ABM around population-level inference with uncertainty-aware neuro-symbolic fusion, PhysicsAgentABM establishes a new paradigm for scalable and calibrated simulation with LLMs.",

However, the considerable computational cost of bidirectional full attention limits the inference efficiency. Although sparse attention is promising, existing methods remain ineffective. This stems from the need to estimate attention importance for tokens yet to be decoded, while the unmasked token positions are unknown during diffusion. In this paper, we present Focus-dLLM, a novel training-free attention sparsification framework tailored for accurate and efficient long-context dLLM inference. Based on the finding that token confidence strongly correlates across adjacent steps, we first design a past confidence-guided indicator to predict unmasked regions. Built upon this, we propose a sink-aware pruning strategy to accurately estimate and remove redundant attention computation, while preserving highly influential attention sinks. To further reduce overhead, this strategy reuses identified sink locations across layers, leveraging the observed cross-layer consistency. Experimental results show that our method offers more than 29× lossless speedup under 32K context length.",

      "abstract": "Most Large Language Model (LLM) agent memory systems rely on a small set of static, hand-designed operations for extracting memory. These fixed procedures hard-code human priors about what to store and how to revise memory, making them rigid under diverse interaction patterns and inefficient on long histories. To this end, we present \\textbf{MemSkill}, which reframes these operations as learnable and evolvable memory skills, structured and reusable routines for extracting, consolidating, and pruning information from interaction traces. Inspired by the design philosophy of agent skills, MemSkill employs a \\emph{controller} that learns to select a small set of relevant skills, paired with an LLM-based \\emph{executor} that produces skill-guided memories. Beyond learning skill selection, MemSkill introduces a \\emph{designer} that periodically reviews hard cases where selected skills yield incorrect or incomplete memories, and evolves the skill set by proposing refinements and new skills. Together, MemSkill forms a closed-loop procedure that improves both the skill-selection policy and the skill set itself. Experiments on LoCoMo, LongMemEval, HotpotQA, and ALFWorld demonstrate that MemSkill improves task performance over strong baselines and generalizes well across settings. Further analyses shed light on how skills evolve, offering insights toward more adaptive, self-evolving memory management for LLM agents.

      "abstract": "High-quality kernel is critical for scalable AI systems, and enabling LLMs to generate such code would advance AI development. However, training LLMs for this task requires sufficient data, a robust environment, and the process is often vulnerable to reward hacking and lazy optimization. In these cases, models may hack training rewards and prioritize trivial correctness over meaningful speedup. In this paper, we systematically study reinforcement learning (RL) for kernel generation. We first design KernelGYM, a robust distributed GPU environment that supports reward hacking check, data collection from multi-turn interactions and long-term RL training. Building on KernelGYM , we investigate effective multi-turn RL methods and identify a biased policy gradient issue caused by self-inclusion in GRPO. To solve this, we propose Turn-level Reinforce-Leave-One-Out ( TRLOO ) to provide unbiased advantage estimation for multi-turn RL. To alleviate lazy optimization, we incorporate mismatch correction for training stability and introduce Profiling-based Rewards ( PR ) and Profiling-based Rejection Sampling ( PRS ) to overcome the issue. The trained model, this Dr. Kernel-14B, reaches performance competitive with Claude-4.5-Sonnet in Kernelbench. Finally, we study sequential test-time scaling for this Dr. Kernel-14B. On the KernelBench Level-2 subset, 31.6% of the generated kernels achieve at least a 1.2x speedup over the Torch reference, surpassing Claude-4.5-Sonnet (26.7%) and GPT-5 (28.6%). When selecting the best candidate across all turns, this 1.2x speedup rate further increases to 47.8%. All resources, including environment, training code, models, and dataset, are included in this hkust-nlp/KernelGYM .",

      "abstract": "Training-time privileged information (PI) can enable language models to succeed on tasks they would otherwise fail, making it a powerful tool for reinforcement learning in hard, long-horizon settings. However, transferring capabilities learned with PI to policies that must act without it at inference time remains a fundamental challenge. We study this problem in the context of distilling frontier models for multi-turn agentic environments, where closed-source systems typically hide their internal reasoning and expose only action trajectories. This breaks standard distillation pipelines, since successful behavior is observable but the reasoning process is not. For this, we introduce {\\pi}-Distill, a joint teacher-student objective that trains a PI-conditioned teacher and an unconditioned student simultaneously using the same model. Additionally, we also introduce On-Policy Self-Distillation (OPSD), an alternative approach that trains using Reinforcement Learning (RL) with a reverse KL-penalty between the student and the PI-conditioned teacher. We show that both of these algorithms effectively distill frontier agents using action-only PI. Specifically we find that {\\pi}-Distill and in some cases OPSD, outperform industry standard practices (Supervised finetuning followed by RL) that assume access to full Chain-of-Thought supervision across multiple agentic benchmarks, models, and forms of PI. We complement our results with extensive analysis that characterizes the factors enabling effective learning with PI, focusing primarily on {\\pi}-Distill and characterizing when OPSD is competitive.",

However, in agentic settings, LLMs often struggle to anticipate action consequences and adapt to environment dynamics, highlighting the need for world-modeling capabilities in LLM-based agents. We propose Reinforcement World Model Learning (RWML), a self-supervised method that learns action-conditioned world models for LLM-based agents on textual states using sim-to-real gap rewards. Our method aligns simulated next states produced by the model with realized next states observed from the environment, encouraging consistency between internal world simulations and actual environment dynamics in a pre-trained embedding space. Unlike next-state token prediction, which prioritizes token-level fidelity (i.e., reproducing exact wording) over semantic equivalence and can lead to model collapse, our method provides a more robust training signal and is empirically less susceptible to reward hacking than LLM-as-a-judge. We evaluate our method on ALFWorld and τ2 Bench and observe significant gains over the base model, despite being entirely self-supervised. When combined with task-success rewards, our method outperforms direct task-success reward RL by 6.9 and 5.7 points on ALFWorld and τ2 Bench respectively, while matching the performance of expert-data training.",

      "abstract": "Despite strong performance on existing benchmarks, it remains unclear whether large language models can reason over genuinely novel scientific information. Most evaluations score end-to-end RAG pipelines, where reasoning is confounded with retrieval and toolchain choices, and the signal is further contaminated by parametric memorization and open-web volatility. We introduce DeR2, a controlled deep-research sandbox that isolates document-grounded reasoning while preserving core difficulties of deep search: multi-step synthesis, denoising, and evidence-based conclusion making. DeR2 decouples evidence access from reasoning via four regimes--Instruction-only, Concepts (gold concepts without documents), Related-only (only relevant documents), and Full-set (relevant documents plus topically related distractors)--yielding interpretable regime gaps that operationalize retrieval loss vs. reasoning loss and enable fine-grained error attribution. To prevent parametric leakage, we apply a two-phase validation that requires parametric failure without evidence while ensuring oracle-concept solvability. To ensure reproducibility, each instance provides a frozen document library (drawn from 2023-2025 theoretical papers) with expert-annotated concepts and validated rationales. Experiments across a diverse set of state-of-the-art foundation models reveal substantial variation and significant headroom: some models exhibit mode-switch fragility, performing worse with the Full-set than with Instruction-only, while others show structural concept misuse, correctly naming concepts but failing to execute them as procedures.",

While recent methods often rely on heuristic approaches to balance efficiency and quality, the fundamental relationship between original and synthetic data remains underexplored. This paper revisits knowledge distillation-based dataset distillation within a solid theoretical framework. We introduce the concepts of Informativeness and Utility, capturing crucial information within a sample and essential samples in the training set, respectively. Building on these principles, we define optimal dataset distillation mathematically. We then present InfoUtil, a framework that balances informativeness and utility in synthesizing the distilled dataset. InfoUtil incorporates two key components: (1) game-theoretic informativeness maximization using Shapley Value attribution to extract key information from samples, and (2) principled utility maximization by selecting globally influential samples based on Gradient Norm. These components ensure that the distilled dataset is both informative and utility-optimized. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves a 6.1% performance improvement over the previous state-of-the-art approach on ImageNet-1K dataset using ResNet-18.",

While models excel at execution, users often struggle to guide them effectively due to insufficient domain expertise, the difficulty of articulating precise intent, and the inability to reliably validate complex outputs. It presents a critical challenge in scalable oversight: enabling humans to responsibly steer AI systems on tasks that surpass their own ability to specify or verify. To tackle this, we propose Scalable Interactive Oversight, a framework that decomposes complex intent into a recursive tree of manageable decisions to amplify human supervision. Rather than relying on open-ended prompting, our system elicits low-burden feedback at each node and recursively aggregates these signals into precise global guidance. Validated in web development task, our framework enables non-experts to produce expert-level Product Requirement Documents, achieving a 54% improvement in alignment. Crucially, we demonstrate that this framework can be optimized via Reinforcement Learning using only online user feedback, offering a practical pathway for maintaining human control as AI scales.",

Meanwhile, LLM-based retrievers have demonstrated strong capability in following instructions or reasoning. This raises a critical question: can LLM-based retrievers effectively contribute to deep research agent workflows? To investigate this, we introduce SAGE, a benchmark for scientific literature retrieval comprising 1,200 queries across four scientific domains, with a 200,000-paper retrieval corpus. We evaluate six deep research agents and find that all systems struggle with reasoning-intensive retrieval. Using DR Tulu as backbone, we further compare BM25 and LLM-based retrievers (i.e. ReasonIR and gte-Qwen2-7B-instruct) as alternative search tools. Surprisingly, BM25 significantly outperforms LLM-based retrievers by approximately 30%, as existing agents generate keyword-oriented sub-queries. To improve performance, we propose a corpus-level test-time scaling framework that uses LLMs to augment documents with metadata and keywords, making retrieval easier for off-the-shelf retrievers. This yields 8% and 2% gains on short-form and open-ended questions, respectively.",

      "title": "DASH: Faster Shampoo via Batched Block Preconditioning and Efficient Inverse-Root Solvers",
      "abstract": "We propose DASH ( D istributed A ccelerated SH ampoo), a faster and more accurate version of Distributed Shampoo. To make it faster, we stack the blocks extracted from the preconditioners to obtain a 3D tensor, which are inverted efficiently using batch-matmuls via iterative procedures. To make it more accurate, we introduce an existing iterative method from Numerical Linear Algebra called Newton-DB, which is more accurate than the existing Coupled Newton implemented in Distributed Shampoo. These iterative procedures usually require the largest eigen-value of the input matrix to be upper bounded by 1, which should be obtained by scaling the input matrix. In theory, one should divide by the true largest eigen-value of the matrix, which is expensive to compute in Distributed Shampoo. Before our work, the simplest scaling was Frobenius norm, which is usually much larger than the largest eigen-value. Since we work with all blocks in parallel in a stacked form, our implementation allows running Power-Iteration to estimate the largest eigen-value for all blocks in one shot. Why is this better? When we scale the input matrix by Frobenius norm, the spectrum is shifted towards zero. We show that iterative procedures require more steps to converge for small eigen-values compared to larger ones. Therefore, scaling by an approximation of the largest eigen-value is desired and in our DASH implementation this is cheaper and therefore leads to faster training and more accurate models.

      "abstract": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have recently been applied to universal multimodal retrieval, where Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning improves candidate reranking. However, existing approaches remain largely language-driven, relying on static visual encodings and lacking the ability to actively verify fine-grained visual evidence, which often leads to speculative reasoning in visually ambiguous cases. We propose V-Retrver, an evidence-driven retrieval framework that reformulates multimodal retrieval as an agentic reasoning process grounded in visual inspection. V-Retrver enables an MLLM to selectively acquire visual evidence during reasoning via external visual tools, performing a multimodal interleaved reasoning process that alternates between hypothesis generation and targeted visual verification.To train such an evidence-gathering retrieval agent, we adopt a curriculum-based learning strategy combining supervised reasoning activation, rejection-based refinement, and reinforcement learning with an evidence-aligned objective. Experiments across multiple multimodal retrieval benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements in retrieval accuracy (with 23.0% improvements on average), perception-driven reasoning reliability, and generalization.",

      "abstract": "This paper addresses a fundamental limitation in graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, which we characterize as the \"Static Graph Fallacy.\" While recent methods have successfully utilized Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to capture multi-hop dependencies, the reliance on fixed transition probabilities often results in semantic drift, where retrieval is diverted toward high-degree \"hub\" nodes rather than relevant evidence. CatRAG introduces a context-aware traversal framework that transforms the static KG into a query-adaptive navigation structure. By integrating symbolic anchoring and dynamic edge weighting, the system effectively prunes irrelevant paths and amplifies those aligned with the query’s specific intent. A key finding of our work is that while standard recall metrics show modest gains, there is a significant improvement in \"reasoning completeness\"—the ability to recover the entire evidence chain without gaps. This shift from partial context retrieval to grounded reasoning paths is a necessary step for robust multi-hop RAG. We look forward to discussing the implications of dynamic graph steering and how these techniques might scale to increasingly large and heterogeneous knowledge structures.",

      "abstract": "Adaptive 1D Video Diffusion Autoencoder Recent video generation models largely rely on video autoencoders that compress pixel-space videos into latent representations. However, existing video autoencoders suffer from three major limitations: (1) fixed-rate compression that wastes tokens on simple videos, (2) inflexible CNN architectures that prevent variable-length latent modeling, and (3) deterministic decoders that struggle to recover appropriate details from compressed latents. To address these issues, we propose One-Dimensional Diffusion Video Autoencoder (One-DVA), a transformer-based framework for adaptive 1D encoding and diffusion-based decoding. The encoder employs query-based vision transformers to extract spatiotemporal features and produce latent representations, while a variable-length dropout mechanism dynamically adjusts the latent length. The decoder is a pixel-space diffusion transformer that reconstructs videos with the latents as input conditions. With a two-stage training strategy, One-DVA achieves performance comparable to 3D-CNN VAEs on reconstruction metrics at identical compression ratios. More importantly, it supports adaptive compression and thus can achieve higher compression ratios. To better support downstream latent generation, we further regularize the One-DVA latent distribution for generative modeling and fine-tune its decoder to mitigate artifacts caused by the generation process.",

We propose PhysicsAgentABM, which shifts inference to behaviorally coherent agent clusters: state-specialized symbolic agents encode mechanistic transition priors, a multimodal neural transition model captures temporal and interaction dynamics, and uncertainty-aware epistemic fusion yields calibrated cluster-level transition distributions. Individual agents then stochastically realize transitions under local constraints, decoupling population inference from entity-level variability. We further introduce ANCHOR, an LLM agent-driven clustering strategy based on cross-contextual behavioral responses and a novel contrastive loss, reducing LLM calls by up to 6-8 times. Experiments across public health, finance, and social sciences show consistent gains in event-time accuracy and calibration over mechanistic, neural, and LLM baselines. By re-architecting generative ABM around population-level inference with uncertainty-aware neuro-symbolic fusion, PhysicsAgentABM establishes a new paradigm for scalable and calibrated simulation with LLMs.",

      "abstract": "Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) deliver strong long-context processing capability in a non-autoregressive decoding paradigm. However, the considerable computational cost of bidirectional full attention limits the inference efficiency. Although sparse attention is promising, existing methods remain ineffective. This stems from the need to estimate attention importance for tokens yet to be decoded, while the unmasked token positions are unknown during diffusion. In this paper, we present Focus-dLLM, a novel training-free attention sparsification framework tailored for accurate and efficient long-context dLLM inference. Based on the finding that token confidence strongly correlates across adjacent steps, we first design a past confidence-guided indicator to predict unmasked regions. Built upon this, we propose a sink-aware pruning strategy to accurately estimate and remove redundant attention computation, while preserving highly influential attention sinks. To further reduce overhead, this strategy reuses identified sink locations across layers, leveraging the observed cross-layer consistency. Experimental results show that our method offers more than 29× lossless speedup under 32K context length.",

      "abstract": "Current Vision–Language–Action (VLA) models rely on fixed computational depth, expending the same amount of compute on simple adjustments and complex multi-step manipulation. While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting enables variable computation, it scales memory linearly and is ill-suited for continuous action spaces. We introduce Recurrent-Depth VLA (RD-VLA), an architecture that achieves computational adaptivity via latent iterative refinement rather than explicit token generation. RD-VLA employs a recurrent, weight-tied action head that supports arbitrary inference depth with a constant memory footprint. The model is trained using truncated backpropagation through time (TBPTT) to efficiently supervise the refinement process. At inference, RD-VLA dynamically allocates compute using an adaptive stopping criterion based on latent convergence. Experiments on challenging manipulation tasks show that recurrent depth is critical: tasks that fail entirely (0% success) with single-iteration inference exceed 90% success with four iterations, while simpler tasks saturate rapidly. RD-VLA provides a scalable path to test-time compute in robotics, replacing token-based reasoning with latent reasoning to achieve constant memory usage and up to 80× inference speedup over prior reasoning-based VLA models.",

      "abstract": "Deploying GRPO on Flow Matching models has proven effective for text-to-image generation. However, existing paradigms typically propagate an outcome-based reward to all preceding denoising steps without distinguishing the local effect of each step. Moreover, current group-wise ranking mainly compares trajectories at matched timesteps and ignores within-trajectory dependencies, where certain early denoising actions can affect later states via delayed, implicit interactions. We propose TurningPoint-GRPO (TP-GRPO), a GRPO framework that alleviates step-wise reward sparsity and explicitly models long-term effects within the denoising trajectory. TP-GRPO makes two key innovations: (i) it replaces outcome-based rewards with step-level incremental rewards, providing a dense, step-aware learning signal that better isolates each denoising action's \"pure\" effect, and (ii) it identifies turning points-steps that flip the local reward trend and make subsequent reward evolution consistent with the overall trajectory trend-and assigns these actions an aggregated long-term reward to capture their delayed impact. Turning points are detected solely via sign changes in incremental rewards, making TP-GRPO efficient and hyperparameter-free. Extensive experiments also demonstrate that TP-GRPO exploits reward signals more effectively and consistently improves generation.",

      "abstract": "Recent advancements in image generation models have enabled the prediction of future Graphical User Interface (GUI) states based on user instructions. However, existing benchmarks primarily focus on general domain visual fidelity, leaving the evaluation of state transitions and temporal coherence in GUI-specific contexts underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce GEBench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating dynamic interaction and temporal coherence in GUI generation. GEBench comprises 700 carefully curated samples spanning five task categories, covering both single-step interactions and multi-step trajectories across real-world and fictional scenarios, as well as grounding point localization. To support systematic evaluation, we propose GE-Score, a novel five-dimensional metric that assesses Goal Achievement, Interaction Logic, Content Consistency, UI Plausibility, and Visual Quality. Extensive evaluations on current models indicate that while they perform well on single-step transitions, they struggle significantly with maintaining temporal coherence and spatial grounding over longer interaction sequences. Our findings identify icon interpretation, text rendering, and localization precision as critical bottlenecks. This work provides a foundation for systematic assessment and suggests promising directions for future research toward building high-fidelity generative GUI environments.

      "title": "Learning Query-Aware Budget-Tier Routing for Runtime Agent Memory",
      "abstract": "Memory is increasingly central to Large Language Model (LLM) agents operating beyond a single context window, yet most existing systems rely on offline, query-agnostic memory construction that can be inefficient and may discard query-critical information. Although runtime memory utilization is a natural alternative, prior work often incurs substantial overhead and offers limited explicit control over the performance-cost trade-off. In this work, we present BudgetMem, a runtime agent memory framework for explicit, query-aware performance-cost control. BudgetMem structures memory processing as a set of memory modules, each offered in three budget tiers (i.e., Low/Mid/High). A lightweight router performs budget-tier routing across modules to balance task performance and memory construction cost, which is implemented as a compact neural policy trained with reinforcement learning. Using BudgetMem as a unified testbed, we study three complementary strategies for realizing budget tiers: implementation (method complexity), reasoning (inference behavior), and capacity (module model size). Across LoCoMo, LongMemEval, and HotpotQA, BudgetMem surpasses strong baselines when performance is prioritized (i.e., high-budget setting), and delivers better accuracy-cost frontiers under tighter budgets. Moreover, our analysis disentangles the strengths and weaknesses of different tiering strategies, clarifying when each axis delivers the most favorable trade-offs under varying budget regimes.",

Data: We collected a new dataset of reasoning trajectories from symbolic tasks to focus purely on logic, stripping away the distraction of real-world knowledge. Method: We tested various ways to induce these skills intoLLMs, ranging from simple fine-tuning to more advanced structural changes like Mixture-of-Experts (MoE).

The resulting model, TermiGen-Qwen2.5-Coder-32B, achieves a state-of-the-art 31.3% pass rate on TerminalBench, outperforming existing open-source baselines and even surpassing proprietary models like GPT-4o-mini.",

      "abstract": "Solving open-ended science questions remains challenging for large language models, particularly due to inherently unreliable supervision and evaluation. The bottleneck lies in the data construction and reward design for scientific post-training. We develop a large-scale, systematic data processing pipeline that transforms heterogeneous open-source science data into Dr. SCI dataset, which comprises of 1M questions across eight STEM subjects, with explicit verifiable/open-ended splits, scalable difficulty annotation, and fine-grained rubrics that operationalize evaluation for open-ended answers. Building on this dataset, we propose the Dr. SCI post-training pipeline, which redesigns the standard SFT -> RL workflow through three components: (i) Exploration-Expanding SFT, which broadens the model's reasoning pattern coverage prior to RL; (ii) Dynamic Difficulty Curriculum, which adapts training data to the model's evolving scientific capability; and (iii) SciRubric-Guided RL, which enables stable reinforcement learning on open-ended scientific questions via rubric-based evaluation with explicit answer correctness. Qwen3-4B-Base trained using Dr. SCI pipeline achieves 63.2 on GPQA-diamond and 32.4 on GPQA-general, consistently improves over strong post-trained baselines such as o1-mini and GPT-4o, demonstrating substantial gains in scientific reasoning, especially in open-ended settings.",

In this report, we introduce SoulX-Singer, a high-quality open-source SVS system designed with practical deployment considerations in mind. SoulX-Singer supports controllable singing generation conditioned on either symbolic musical scores (MIDI) or melodic representations, enabling flexible and expressive control in real-world production workflows. Trained on more than 42,000 hours of vocal data, the system supports Mandarin Chinese, English, and Cantonese and consistently achieves state-of-the-art synthesis quality across languages under diverse musical conditions. Furthermore, to enable reliable evaluation of zero-shot SVS performance in practical scenarios, we construct SoulX-Singer-Eval, a dedicated benchmark with strict training-test disentanglement, facilitating systematic assessment in zero-shot settings.",

We found that SWE-Bench-Verified scores can vary by 2.2 to 6.0 percentage points, making small improvements hard to distinguish from noise. Read more at: https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07150",

      "abstract": "Tokenization is a pivotal design choice for morphologically rich languages like Turkish, where productive agglutination strains both vocabulary efficiency and morphological fidelity. Despite growing interest, prior work often varies vocabulary size without controlling the tokenizer’s training corpus, offers sparse intrinsic diagnostics, and tests a narrow band of downstream tasks. We present the first comprehensive, principled study of Turkish subword tokenization—a “subwords manifest”—that jointly varies vocabulary and corpus size, compares multiple tokenizer families under matched budgets (WordPiece, morphology‑level, and character baselines), and evaluates broadly across semantic, syntactic, and morphology‑sensitive probes. To explain why tokenizers succeed or fail, we introduce a morphology‑aware diagnostic toolkit that moves beyond coarse aggregates to boundary‑level F1, lemma atomicity vs. surface boundary hits, over/under‑segmentation indices, edit distances (CER/WER), continuation rates, and affix‑type coverage and atomicity. Our contributions deliver a systematic analysis of the vocabulary–corpus–success triad, a unified evaluation framework linking intrinsic diagnostics to extrinsic outcomes, controlled comparisons that identify when character‑ and morphology‑level tokenization pay off, and an open‑source release of code, pipelines, and models for reproducible research.",

      "abstract": "GraphAgents: Knowledge Graph-Guided Agentic AI for Cross-Domain Materials Design Large Language Models (LLMs) promise to accelerate discovery by reasoning across the expanding scientific landscape. Yet, the challenge is no longer access to information but connecting it in meaningful, domain-spanning ways. In materials science, where innovation demands integrating concepts from molecular chemistry to mechanical performance, this is especially acute. Neither humans nor single-agent LLMs can fully contend with this torrent of information, with the latter often prone to hallucinations. To address this bottleneck, we introduce a multi-agent framework guided by large-scale knowledge graphs to find sustainable substitutes for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS)-chemicals currently under intense regulatory scrutiny. Agents in the framework specialize in problem decomposition, evidence retrieval, design parameter extraction, and graph traversal, uncovering latent connections across distinct knowledge pockets to support hypothesis generation. Ablation studies show that the full multi-agent pipeline outperforms single-shot prompting, underscoring the value of distributed specialization and relational reasoning. We demonstrate that by tailoring graph traversal strategies, the system alternates between exploitative searches focusing on domain-critical outcomes and exploratory searches surfacing emergent cross-connections. Illustrated through the exemplar of biomedical tubing, the framework generates sustainable PFAS-free alternatives that balance tribological performance, thermal stability, chemical resistance, and biocompatibility. This work establishes a framework combining knowledge graphs with multi-agent reasoning to expand the materials design space, showcasing several initial design candidates to demonstrate the approach.",

To this end, Anchored Decoding is a decoding technique for language models (LMs) that provably reduces the likelihood of generating copyrighted text. It requires two LMs: a safe model trained exclusively on permissively licensed data, and a risky model that is higher-utility and trained on mixed-licensed data. Anchored Decoding works for both token-level and byte-level decoding. To make this algorithm as practical as possible, we release (1) TinyLlama 1.8B , a safe base LM that is tokenizer-compatible with the Llama 3 model family, and (2) byte-level support to facilitate mixed-tokenizer decoding.",

We argue this brittleness is often data-induced: when images carry \"silent\" evidence and queries leave key semantics implicit, a single embedding pass must both reason and compress, encouraging spurious feature matching. We propose a data-centric framework that decouples these roles by externalizing reasoning before retrieval. Using a strong Vision--Language Model, we make implicit semantics explicit by densely captioning visual evidence in corpus entries, resolving ambiguous multimodal references in queries, and rewriting verbose instructions into concise retrieval constraints. Inference-time enhancement alone is insufficient; the retriever must be trained on these semantically dense representations to avoid distribution shift and fully exploit the added signal. Across M-BEIR, our reasoning-augmented training method yields consistent gains over strong baselines, with ablations showing that corpus enhancement chiefly benefits knowledge-intensive queries while query enhancement is critical for compositional modification requests.",

Beyond implementation, the formalization process exposes and resolves implicit assumptions and missing details in standard SLT textbooks, enforcing a granular, line-by-line understanding of the theory.

      "title": "OPUS: Towards Efficient and Principled Data Selection in Large Language Model Pre-training in Every Iteration",
      "abstract": "In this paper, we argue that LLM pre-training is entering a “data-wall” regime where readily available high-quality public text is approaching exhaustion, so progress must shift from more tokens to better tokens chosen at the right time. While most existing pipelines either (i) apply static, training-agnostic quality filters or (ii) use dynamic selection criteria defined in raw gradient space, modern LLMs are actually trained with adaptive optimizers like AdamW or Muon whose preconditioning reshapes the effective update direction—creating a fundamental mismatch between “how we score data” and “how training truly updates the model.” To bridge this gap, we introduce OPUS (Optimizer-induced Projected Utility Selection), a dynamic selection framework that defines data utility directly in the optimizer-induced update space: a sample is valuable insofar as its optimizer-shaped effective update aligns with the descent direction of a stable, high-quality target distribution (our proxy). Concretely, OPUS operationalizes this idea through a principled objective, a scalable estimator, and a diversity-preserving selection rule. Our key contributions are: (1) an optimizer-aware utility for dynamic selection, with closed-form approximations for effective update directions under AdamW and Muon, aligning scoring with real training geometry; (2) BENCH-PROXY, an in-distribution proxy construction method that retrieves benchmark-aligned samples from the pre-training corpus to stabilize the target direction; (3) scalable utility estimation using the Ghost technique + CountSketch projections to avoid per-sample gradient materialization; and (4) Boltzmann sampling with redundancy control to prevent diversity collapse under non-stationary streams. Empirically, OPUS delivers strong data/compute efficiency: it reports only ~4.7% additional compute overhead for selection while achieving large gains across datasets, optimizers, and scales—including improved accuracy (+2.2% average over 10 benchmarks and 8× compute reduction in one highlighted setting), outperforming industrial static/dynamic baselines and even matching or exceeding much longer-token training in several regimes.",

Agents trained purely on synthetic envs generalize to out-of-distribution benchmarks. Code, Environments, & Models all open-sourced. 🔥 We train Qwen3 (4B/8B/14B) with online RL using GRPO algorithm at serious scale: ⚡ 1,024 parallel env instances per training step 🎯 Hybrid reward: step-level format checks + task-level outcome verification 🧠 History-aware training: align sliding-window truncation between training & inference Key insight: code-driven environments give more stable learning signals than LLM-simulated ones, and they're orders of magnitude faster. Results on 3 out-of-distribution benchmarks (AWM does NOT target any benchmark specific ones): 📊 BFCLv3 : 8B jumps 53.83 → 65.94 (+12.11) 📊 τ²-bench : competitive, 14B reaches 39.03 Pass@1 📊 MCP-Universe : best overall, 8B: 6.70 → 11.17 🏆 AWM is the ONLY method that improves over Base on ALL three benchmarks. 📄 Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10090 💻 Code: https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/agent-world-model 🤗 Huggingface: https://huggingface.co/datasets/Snowflake/AgentWorldModel-1K",

      "abstract": "In this paper we propose a new interpretability method LatentLens. With this we can finally show that visual tokens are actually interpretable across all layers in an LLM, something that past methods like logit lens and or using the LLM's embedding matrix would not be able to do. Our key insight is to use a large pool of contextual embeddings from the LLM to find nearest neighbors instead of just using a static embedding or unembedding matrix: We empirically show how well LatentLens works in a controlled setting with 9 model combinations as well as an off-the-shelf VLM. We also notice that the Mid-Layer Leap phenomenon: visual tokens as they arrive at the LLM input are already most aligned to later semantic LLM layers! So for example a visual token arriving at layer 0 (coming from the vision encoder --> MLP), will have its closest nearest neighbors from e.g. layer 8 of the LLM. We hope this will spark new VLM interpretability research and even projects on other kinds of latent representations in LLM (soft prompts, speech, VLAs, ...)!",

To tackle long-horizon tasks and semantic generalization, we formulate language-conditioned action learning as a long-sequence interleaved planning problem. These modalities are structured into a unified sequence, enabling the model to generate predictions across all three modalities based on the interleaved context. To address the high latency in combining visual generation with control, we introduce Residual Flow Guidance (RFG). Instead of generating future frames from scratch, RFG conditions on the current observation as a strong structural prior and performs single-step denoising to predict the residual change toward the next keyframe. RFG provides a lightweight predictive visual representation that captures task-relevant dynamics with minimal overhead. This substantially reduces the computational cost of foresight while preserving its utility for action generation.",

      "abstract": "The prevalent paradigm in robot learning attempts to generalize across environments, embodiments, and tasks with language prompts at runtime. A fundamental tension limits this approach: language is often too abstract to guide the concrete physical understanding required for robust manipulation. In this work, we introduce Contact-Anchored Policies (CAP), a new class of general robotic behavior models, which replace language conditioning with points of physical contact in space. Simultaneously, we structure CAP as a library of modular utility models rather than a monolithic generalist policy. This factorization allows us to implement an efficient real-to-sim iteration cycle: we build EgoGym, a lightweight simulation benchmark, to rapidly identify failure modes and refine our models and datasets prior to real-world deployment. We show that by conditioning on contact and iterating via simulation, CAP generalizes to novel environments and embodiments out of the box on three fundamental manipulation skills while using only 23 hours of demonstration data, and outperforms large, state-of-the-art VLAs in zero-shot evaluations by 56%. All model checkpoints, codebase, hardware, simulation, and datasets will be open-sourced.",

Just like a child learns to fold a paper airplane or build a LEGO from video tutorials👶 😎Thrilled to introduce VideoWorld 2, the successor of VideoWorld. Unlike Sora and Veo, it is the the first generative model that masters complex real-world knowledge solely through visual data, without any reliance on language models. 🙋 You might wonder: what knowledge remains out of reach for today’s AI?  Try asking Sora 2 or Veo 3 to fold a coherent paper boat, or have Gemini describe every micro-fold and material change in text.  Although any child can master this skill just by watching video tutorials, today's most advanced AI often fails at such tasks. 🚀To address this challenge, we propose VideoWorld 2. Unlike models that rely on language priors, it is the first to master complex, long-horizon real-world knowledge solely by \"watching\" raw videos and  generalizing the skill to new environments. 🧑‍🏫 The \"Cambrian Moment\" for AI? As Dr. Feifei Li noted, vision-enabled perception and planning triggered the Cambrian Explosion 540 million years ago. VideoWorld 2 explores this frontier:  Without any textual descriptions, it completes minute-long handcraft tasks like paper folding and block-building, which involve fine-grained manipulation and long-horizon planning that current AI fails to learn. Furthermore, it can generalize these skills across various unseen scenes and perform multi-task, cross-environment robotic manipulation. Our main contributions are: 👉We explore, for the first time, how to learn complex, long-range skills from raw videos and generalize them to new environments. We find that disentangling visual appearance from core dynamics is the key to mastering world knowledge. 👉We propose VideoWorld 2, leveraging a dynamic-enhanced Latent Dynamic Model to extract task-relevant dynamics to boost long-horizon tasks success rates by up to 70% 👉We construct Video-CraftBench, a large-scale video-based handcraft dataset for training and evaluation, facilitating future research on knowledge learning from pure videos.",

      "abstract": "Activation steering has emerged as a promising method for efficiently adapting large language models (LLMs) to downstream behaviors. However, most existing steering approaches identify and steer the model from a single static direction for each task or concept, which is inflexible under task variation and insufficient for complex tasks requiring multiple coordinated capabilities. To address this gap, we propose Steer2Adapt, a lightweight framework that enables efficient LLM adaptation by composing steering vectors rather than learning new ones from scratch. In practice, tasks within the same domain (e.g., reasoning or safety) often share a small set of underlying concept dimensions. Steer2Adapt spans these dimensions into a reusable, low-dimensional semantic prior subspace and adapts to new tasks by dynamically discovering a linear combination of basis vectors using only a handful of examples. Experiments across 9 tasks and 3 models in both reasoning and safety domains demonstrate the effectiveness of Steer2Adapt, with an average of 8.2% improvement. Together with our analyses, we establish Steer2Adapt as a data-efficient, stable, and transparent inference-time adaptation method for LLMs.",

      "title": "iGRPO: Self-Feedback-Driven LLM Reasoning",
      "abstract": "Let's discuss Self-Feedback for RL Reasoning (iGRPO) Motivation. Current RL methods for reasoning (GRPO, DAPO, etc.) treat each generation as a one-shot attempt. The model samples, gets a reward, updates, and moves on. But humans almost never solve hard problems in one pass. We draft, re-read, spot mistakes, and refine. Existing RL pipelines don't capture this loop. Some recent methods try to close the gap with critique generation or self-verification, but these ask the model to learn auxiliary behaviors (writing critiques, producing verification rationales) that are only indirectly tied to the actual outcome reward. We wanted something simpler: what if the model's own best attempt is the feedback, and we just train it to beat that attempt? What we built. iGRPO is a two-stage extension of GRPO that adds self-conditioning through the model's own drafts. Stage 1 (Exploratory Draft Generation): Sample multiple candidate solutions from the current policy. Score them with the same scalar reward you're already using. Pick the best one. Stage 2 (Conditioned Refinement): Append that best draft to the original prompt and sample a new group of completions. Apply the standard GRPO-style clipped surrogate update only on these Stage 2 outputs. No critic networks, no reward models, no verification rationales, no generated critiques. The best draft is the only feedback signal, and it comes for free from Stage 1 exploration. The important part: as the policy improves across training, its Stage 1 drafts get stronger, so Stage 2 sees better conditioning, so the policy improves even more. We formally prove this monotonic improvement property under binary rewards: the expected quality of the selected draft increases as the policy's success probability increases. The model doesn't learn to copy the draft. It learns a refinement function that compounds across training. How it differs from critique/verification approaches. Methods like Self-Verification and Critique-GRPO require the model to produce extra text (verification steps, natural-language critiques) and then condition on that. This means the model has to allocate capacity to an auxiliary skill that isn't directly optimized by the outcome reward. iGRPO sidesteps this entirely. The conditioning signal is a full solution attempt scored by the same reward used for optimization. There's no ambiguity about what \"good feedback\" looks like, because it's literally the model's highest-reward output. Key results. Controlled comparisons (matched rollout budgets, same total completions per prompt): Nemotron-H-8B-Base-8K: iGRPO reaches 45.04% average vs. 41.08% for GRPO (+3.96), and beats Self-Verification (42.86%) and Critique-GRPO (43.39%). DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B: iGRPO at 69.87% vs. GRPO at 68.29%, with gains concentrated on multi-step benchmarks like AIME24 (56.30%) and AMC (95.00%). OpenMath-Nemotron-7B: Even with an already strong 74.83% base, iGRPO pushes to 76.07%. At 14B scale, gains persist: DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-14B goes from 71.29% (GRPO) to 73.02% (iGRPO); OpenMath-Nemotron-14B from 76.73% to 78.00%. Stronger base + harder data: OpenReasoning-Nemotron-7B trained on AceReason-Math with iGRPO achieves 85.62% on AIME24 and 79.64% on AIME25, with transfer gains on GPQA (+1.84) and MMLU-Pro (+0.91). The refinement wrapper generalizes beyond GRPO: Applying the same two-stage mechanism to DAPO and GSPO yields +1.19 and +1.11 average improvements respectively, under matched budgets. The gains come from the refinement interface, not GRPO-specific details. Richer rewards help: Swapping the binary outcome checker for a GPT-5 generative judge improves the average from 69.87% to 70.81% (+0.94), with the largest lifts on AIME24/25 and Minerva, consistent with partial credit keeping near-miss traces alive through Stage 1 selection. Learning dynamics: iGRPO delays premature entropy collapse. Both methods start at ~2.45 nats, but GRPO drops to 0.60 by 10% of training while iGRPO decays more gradually (0.80 at 15%). This sustained mid-training exploration lets the model recover from near-miss reasoning traces before converging. Overhead: Peak memory is essentially identical (~54.93 GB for both). Throughput drops from 0.41 to 0.34 samples/sec. Total training time increases by ~13% (83.3 → 94.1 GPU hours). No extra GPUs, no extra memory. In short, iGRPO adds a self-feedback refinement loop to group-based RL that uses the model's own best draft as conditioning. It's simple, adds minimal overhead, generalizes across optimizers, and consistently improves reasoning across model families and scales.",

We present a trajectory expansion framework Anchor that bootstraps scalable desktop supervision from a small set of verified seed demonstrations. Starting from each seed, we identify branch points that correspond to meaningful state changes and propose new, state-grounded task variants conditioned on the current GUI context. An executing agent then follows the proposed instructions to generate new trajectories, while a verifier enforces task completion via state-aware checks and trajectory-level consistency. To improve supervision quality, we further apply task-conditioned step-level filtering to remove ungrounded actions and denoise post-branch segments to maintain coherent intent. Experiments on standard desktop benchmarks, OSWorld and WindowsAgentArena, show that models fine-tuned on our expanded corpus achieve consistent improvements over zero-shot agents and representative synthesis baselines, and generalize across applications and operating systems.",

      "title": "OPE: Overcoming Information Saturation in Parallel Thinking via Outline-Guided Path Exploration",
      "abstract": "Parallel thinking has emerged as a new paradigm for large reasoning models (LRMs) in tackling complex problems. Recent methods leverage Reinforcement Learning (RL) to enhance parallel thinking, aiming to address the limitations in computational resources and effectiveness encountered with supervised fine-tuning. However, most existing studies primarily focus on optimizing the aggregation phase, with limited attention to the path exploration stage. In this paper, we theoretically analyze the optimization of parallel thinking under the Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) setting, and identify that the mutual information bottleneck among exploration paths fundamentally restricts overall performance. To address this, we propose Outline-Guided Path Exploration (OPE) , which explicitly partitions the solution space by generating diverse reasoning outlines prior to parallel path reasoning, thereby reducing information redundancy and improving the diversity of information captured across exploration paths. We implement OPE with an iterative RL strategy that optimizes outline planning and outline-guided reasoning independently. Extensive experiments across multiple challenging mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that OPE effectively improves reasoning performance in different aggregation strategies, enabling LRMs to more reliably discover correct solutions.",

      "abstract": "Planning has become a central capability for contemporary agent systems in navigating complex, long-horizon tasks, yet existing approaches predominantly rely on fixed, hand-crafted planning structures that lack the flexibility to adapt to the structural diversity of open-ended problems. To address this limitation, we introduce TodoEvolve, a meta-planning paradigm that autonomously synthesizes and dynamically revises task-specific planning architectures. Specifically, we first construct PlanFactory, a modular design space that standardizes diverse planning paradigms within a unified codebase encompassing topology, initialization, adaptation, and navigation, thereby providing a common interface for heterogeneous planning patterns. Leveraging PlanFactory, we collect high-quality planning trajectories and train Todo-14B via \\textit{Impedance-Guided Preference Optimization} (IGPO), a multi-objective reinforcement learning objective that encourages the generation of planning systems that are performant, stable, and token-efficient across arbitrary tasks and agent backbones. Empirical evaluations on five agentic benchmarks demonstrate that TodoEvolve consistently surpasses carefully engineered planning modules while maintaining economical API costs and runtime overhead.",

      "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in software development, yet their tendency to generate insecure code remains a major barrier to real-world deployment. Existing secure code alignment methods often suffer from a functionality–security paradox, improving security at the cost of substantial utility degradation. We propose SecCoderX, an online reinforcement learning framework for functionalitypreserving secure code generation. SecCoderX first bridges vulnerability detection and secure code generation by repurposing mature detection resources in two ways: (i) synthesizing diverse, reality grounded vulnerability-inducing coding tasks for online RL rollouts, and (ii) training a reasoning based vulnerability reward model that provides scalable and reliable security supervision. Together, these components are unified in an online RL loop to align code LLMs to generate secure and functional code. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SecCoderX achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving Effective Safety Rate (ESR) by approximately 10% over unaligned models, whereas prior methods often degrade ESR by 14-54%.

      "abstract": "While flow matching is elegant, its reliance on single-sample conditional velocities leads to high-variance training targets that destabilize optimization and slow convergence. By explicitly characterizing this variance, we identify 1) a high-variance regime near the prior, where optimization is challenging, and 2) a low-variance regime near the data distribution, where conditional and marginal velocities nearly coincide. Leveraging this insight, we propose Stable Velocity , a unified framework that improves both training and sampling. For training, we introduce Stable Velocity Matching (StableVM), an unbiased variance-reduction objective, along with Variance-Aware Representation Alignment (VA-REPA), which adaptively strengthen auxiliary supervision in the low-variance regime. For inference, we show that dynamics in the low-variance regime admit closed-form simplifications, enabling Stable Velocity Sampling (StableVS), a finetuning-free acceleration. Extensive experiments on ImageNet $256\\times256$ and large pretrained text-to-image and text-to-video models, including SD3.5, Flux, Qwen-Image, and Wan2.2, demonstrate consistent improvements in training efficiency and more than $2\\times$ faster sampling within the low-variance regime without degrading sample quality.",

Existing approaches search for individual global directions, implicitly assuming linear separability, which overlooks concepts with nonlinear or multi-dimensional structure. In this work, we leverage Mixture of Factor Analyzers (MFA) as a scalable, unsupervised alternative that models the activation space as a collection of Gaussian regions with their local covariance structure. MFA decomposes activations into two compositional geometric objects: the region's centroid in activation space, and the local variation from the centroid. We train large-scale MFAs for Llama-3.1-8B and Gemma-2-2B, and show they capture complex, nonlinear structures in activation space. Moreover, evaluations on localization and steering benchmarks show that MFA outperforms unsupervised baselines, is competitive with supervised localization methods, and often achieves stronger steering performance than sparse autoencoders. Together, our findings position local geometry, expressed through subspaces, as a promising unit of analysis for scalable concept discovery and model control, accounting for complex structures that isolated directions fail to capture.",

However, standard diffusion transformers fail to converge on these representations directly. While recent work attributes this to a capacity bottleneck proposing computationally expensive width scaling of diffusion transformers we demonstrate that the failure is fundamentally geometric. We identify Geometric Interference as the root cause: standard Euclidean flow matching forces probability paths through the low-density interior of the hyperspherical feature space of representation encoders, rather than following the manifold surface. To resolve this, we propose Riemannian Flow Matching with Jacobi Regularization (RJF). By constraining the generative process to the manifold geodesics and correcting for curvature-induced error propagation, RJF enables standard Diffusion Transformer architectures to converge without width scaling. Our method RJF enables the standard DiT-B architecture (131M parameters) to converge effectively, achieving an FID of 3.37 where prior methods fail to converge.",

      "abstract": "Standard practice selects the most confident model output. I tested the opposite on GPU kernel optimization and found that selecting by surprisal (the model's least confident correct solution) achieves 80% success vs 50% for confidence-guided, with a 3.5x mean speedup advantage. Evaluating just the top 3 by surprisal matches oracle performance at 100%. The key insight: a model's probability distribution maps frequency, not quality. Expert-level CUDA kernels are rare in training data, so the model assigns them low probability despite high performance. That signal is already in the logprobs at zero additional inference cost. I also find that test-time training (gradient adaptation) is worse than random on dense-reward tasks. TTT's best checkpoint (30.6%) falls below a single random sample (53.3%). Gradient updates over-sharpen the distribution, destroying the expert tail where optimal solutions live.

      "abstract": "Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved impressive performance in cross-modal understanding across textual and visual inputs, yet existing benchmarks predominantly focus on pure-text queries. In real-world scenarios, language also frequently appears as visualized text embedded in images, raising the question of whether current VLMs handle such input requests comparably. We introduce VISTA-Bench, a systematic benchmark from multimodal perception, reasoning, to unimodal understanding domains. It evaluates visualized text understanding by contrasting pure-text and visualized-text questions under controlled rendering conditions. Extensive evaluation of over 20 representative VLMs reveals a pronounced modality gap: models that perform well on pure-text queries often degrade substantially when equivalent semantic content is presented as visualized text. This gap is further amplified by increased perceptual difficulty, highlighting sensitivity to rendering variations despite unchanged semantics. Overall, VISTA-Bench provides a principled evaluation framework to diagnose this limitation and to guide progress toward more unified language representations across tokenized text and pixels.

      "abstract": "With the widespread deployment of Computer-using Agents (CUAs) in complex real-world environments, prevalent long-term risks often lead to severe and irreversible consequences. Most existing guardrails for CUAs adopt a reactive approach, constraining agent behavior only within the current observation space. While these guardrails can prevent immediate short-term risks (e.g., clicking on a phishing link), they cannot proactively avoid long-term risks: seemingly reasonable actions can lead to high-risk consequences that emerge with a delay (e.g., cleaning logs leads to future audits being untraceable), which reactive guardrails cannot identify within the current observation space. To address these limitations, we propose a predictive guardrail approach, with the core idea of aligning predicted future risks with current decisions. Based on this approach, we present SafePred, a predictive guardrail framework for CUAs that establishes a risk-to-decision loop to ensure safe agent behavior. SafePred supports two key abilities: (1) Short- and long-term risk prediction: by using safety policies as the basis for risk prediction, SafePred leverages the prediction capability of the world model to generate semantic representations of both short-term and long-term risks, thereby identifying and pruning actions that lead to high-risk states; (2) Decision optimization: translating predicted risks into actionable safe decision guidances through step-level interventions and task-level re-planning. Extensive experiments show that SafePred significantly reduces high-risk behaviors, achieving over 97.6% safety performance and improving task utility by up to 21.4% compared with reactive baselines.",

      "title": "SHARP: Social Harm Analysis via Risk Profiles for Measuring Inequities in Large Language Models",
      "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-stakes domains, where rare but severe failures can result in irreversible harm. However, prevailing evaluation benchmarks often reduce complex social risk to mean-centered scalar scores, thereby obscuring distributional structure, cross-dimensional interactions, and worst-case behavior. This paper introduces Social Harm Analysis via Risk Profiles (SHARP), a framework for multidimensional, distribution-aware evaluation of social harm. SHARP models harm as a multivariate random variable and integrates explicit decomposition into bias, fairness, ethics, and epistemic reliability with a union-of-failures aggregation reparameterized as additive cumulative log-risk. The framework further employs risk-sensitive distributional statistics, with Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR95) as a primary metric, to characterize worst-case model behavior. Application of SHARP to eleven frontier LLMs, evaluated on a fixed corpus of n=901 socially sensitive prompts, reveals that models with similar average risk can exhibit more than twofold differences in tail exposure and volatility. Across models, dimension-wise marginal tail behavior varies systematically across harm dimensions, with bias exhibiting the strongest tail severities, epistemic and fairness risks occupying intermediate regimes, and ethical misalignment consistently lower; together, these patterns reveal heterogeneous, model-dependent failure structures that scalar benchmarks conflate. These findings indicate that responsible evaluation and governance of LLMs require moving beyond scalar averages toward multidimensional, tail-sensitive risk profiling.",

We propose Activation Steering Adapter (ASA), a training-free, inference-time controller that performs a single-shot mid-layer intervention and targets tool domains via a router-conditioned mixture of steering vectors with a probe-guided signed gate to amplify true intent while suppressing spurious triggers. On MTU-Bench with Qwen2.5-1.5B, ASA improves strict tool-use F1 from 0.18 to 0.50 while reducing the false positive rate from 0.15 to 0.05, using only about 20KB of portable assets and no weight updates.",

      "abstract": "Omni-modal large language models (OLLMs) aim to unify multimodal understanding and generation, yet incorporating speech with 3D facial animation remains largely unexplored despite its importance for natural interaction. A key challenge arises from the representation mismatch between discrete, token-level semantic reasoning in LLMs and the dense, fine-grained temporal dynamics required for 3D facial motion, which makes direct modeling difficult to optimize under limited data. We propose Expressive Omni (Ex-Omni), an open-source omni-modal framework that augments OLLMs with speech-accompanied 3D facial animation. Ex-Omni reduces learning difficulty by decoupling semantic reasoning from temporal generation, leveraging speech units as temporal scaffolding and a unified token-as-query gated fusion (TQGF) mechanism for controlled semantic injection. We further introduce InstructEx, a dataset aims to facilitate augment OLLMs with speech-accompanied 3D facial animation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Ex-Omni performs competitively against existing open-source OLLMs while enabling stable aligned speech and facial animation generation.",

We introduce EcoGym, a generalizable benchmark for continuous plan-and-execute decision making in interactive economies. EcoGym comprises three diverse environments: Vending, Freelance, and Operation, implemented in a unified decision-making process with standardized interfaces, and budgeted actions over an effectively unbounded horizon (1000+ steps if 365 day-loops for evaluation). The evaluation of EcoGym is based on business-relevant outcomes (e.g., net worth, income, and DAU), targeting long-term strategic coherence and robustness under partial observability and stochasticity. Experiments across eleven leading LLMs expose a systematic tension: no single model dominates across all three scenarios. Critically, we find that models exhibit significant suboptimality in either high-level strategies or efficient actions executions. EcoGym is released as an open, extensible testbed for transparent long-horizon agent evaluation and for studying controllability-utility trade-offs in realistic economic settings.",

      "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently strengthened LLM reasoning, but its focus on final answer correctness leaves a critical gap: it does not ensure the robustness of the reasoning process itself. We adopt a simple philosophical view, robust reasoning should remain useful beyond the mind that produced it, and treat reasoning as a form of meaning transfer that must survive truncation, reinterpretation, and continuation. Building on this principle, we introduce Reinforcement Learning with Transferable Reward (RLTR), which operationalizes robustness via transfer reward that tests whether a partial reasoning prefix from one model can guide a separate model to the correct answer. This encourages LLMs to produce reasoning that is stable, interpretable, and genuinely generalizable. Our approach improves sampling consistency while improving final answer accuracy, and it reaches comparable performance in substantially fewer training steps. For example, on MATH500, RLTR achieves a +3.6%p gain in Maj@64 compared to RLVR and matches RLVR's average accuracy with roughly 2.5x fewer training steps, providing both more reliable reasoning and significantly more sample efficient.",

      "abstract": "The Magic of Forgetting! Reasoning models enhance problem-solving by scaling test-time compute, yet they face a critical paradox: excessive thinking tokens often degrade performance rather than improve it. We attribute this to a fundamental architectural flaw: standard LLMs operate as \"malloc-only\" engines, continuously accumulating valid and redundant steps alike without a mechanism to prune obsolete information. To break this cycle, we propose Free()LM, a model that introduces an intrinsic self-forgetting capability via the Free-Module, a plug-and-play LoRA adapter. By iteratively switching between reasoning and cleaning modes, Free()LM dynamically identifies and prunes useless context chunks, maintaining a compact and noise-free state. Extensive experiments show that Free()LM provides consistent improvements across all model scales (8B to 685B). It achieves a 3.3% average improvement over top-tier reasoning baselines, even establishing a new SOTA on IMOanswerBench using DeepSeek V3.2-Speciale. Most notably, in long-horizon tasks where the standard Qwen3-235B-A22B model suffers a total collapse (0% accuracy), Free()LM restores performance to 50%. Our findings suggest that sustainable intelligence requires the freedom to forget as much as the power to think.",

      "abstract": "Reasoning Cache: Continual Improvement Over Long Horizons via Short-Horizon RL Large Language Models (LLMs) that can continually improve beyond their training budgets are able to solve increasingly difficult problems by adapting at test time, a property we refer to as extrapolation. However, standard reinforcement learning (RL) operates over fixed problem distributions and training budgets, which limits extrapolation amidst distribution shift at test time. To address this, we introduce RC, an iterative decoding algorithm that replaces standard autoregressive decoding during both training and inference. RC exploits an asymmetry between the response generation and summarization capabilities of LLMs to construct reasoning chains that consistently improve across iterations. Models trained to use RC can extrapolate and continually improve over reasoning horizons more than an order of magnitude longer than those seen during training. Empirically, training a 4B model with RC using a 16k-token training budget improves performance on HMMT 2025 from 40% to nearly 70% with 0.5m tokens at test time, outperforming both comparably sized models and many larger reasoning LLMs. Finally, we also show that models trained with RC can more effectively leverage existing scaffolds to further scale test-time performance, due to the improved summary-conditioned generation abilities learned through training.",

      "abstract": "UMEM: Unified Memory Extraction and Management Framework for Generalizable Memory This paper presents a systematic solution to a core bottleneck in self-evolving agents, offering the following notable contributions: Core Problem Insight The authors accurately identify a fundamental limitation in existing approaches: the decoupled treatment of memory extraction and memory management . Current state-of-the-art methods (e.g., ReMem, Memp) focus solely on optimizing management strategies while treating extraction as a static prompting process. This design leads to two critical pitfalls: Instance-level noise accumulation : Blindly memorizing concrete details rather than generalizable principles results in a \"rote memorization\" trap. Strategy misalignment : Low-quality extracted memories render even optimal management strategies ineffective, creating a \"garbage in, garbage out\" vicious cycle. Methodological Innovations UMEM's key innovation lies in the end-to-end joint optimization of extraction and management , with three pivotal designs ensuring generalizability: Semantic Neighborhood Modeling : Queries are clustered based on cosine similarity, transforming cross-task generalization into an intra-neighborhood consistency optimization problem. Theoretical guarantees for retrieval stability are provided via formal lemmas. Marginal Utility Reward : Memory value is evaluated at the neighborhood level through a novel reward combining success gain and efficiency regularization, compelling the agent to discard instance-specific noise. Online Memory Evolution : The memory bank is dynamically updated during training, enabling co-evolution of policy learning and memory states, thereby overcoming limitations imposed by static memory assumptions. Comprehensive Experimental Validation UMEM achieves significant performance gains over baselines across five heterogeneous benchmarks (AIME, GPQA, ALFWorld, etc.), with improvements up to 10.67% on multi-turn interactive tasks. Ablation studies compellingly demonstrate that optimizing extraction alone is more critical than optimizing management alone (performance drop of 4.70 points vs. 0.73 points), challenging the prevailing \"management-first\" paradigm. Continual evolution experiments reveal that UMEM exhibits a monotonically improving trajectory , whereas baselines such as ReMem rapidly degrade due to noise accumulation—validating the long-term value of the generalization-oriented design. Cross-model transfer experiments (Qwen3 → GPT-5.1 → Gemini) confirm that extracted memories possess architecture-agnostic utility. Broader Impact and Implications This work redefines the optimization paradigm for self-evolving agents: memory quality hinges on the synergy between extraction and management, rather than maximal optimization of either component in isolation . The \"neighborhood generalization\" principle offers valuable insights for continual learning and experience transfer. Notably, the paper draws an analogy between agent evolution and neural network training (forward inference + backward optimization), providing a fresh perspective on understanding learning mechanisms in LLM-based agents. Directions for Further Discussion The reliance on pretrained encoders for semantic neighborhood construction warrants deeper investigation into generalization boundaries under out-of-distribution tasks. Trade-offs between computational overhead (evaluating N neighborhood queries) and real-time deployment requirements merit further exploration. Potential complementarity with parameter-based continual learning approaches remains an open avenue for integration. In summary, through rigorous problem deconstruction and an innovative joint optimization framework, UMEM establishes a vital pathway toward building truly sustainable self-evolving agents. It represents a substantive and well-grounded contribution to the field of memory-augmented agent research.",

We introduce Think-in-Control (TIC)-VLA, a latency-aware framework that explicitly models delayed semantic reasoning during action generation. TIC-VLA defines a delayed semantic-control interface that conditions action generation on delayed vision-language semantic states and explicit latency metadata, in addition to current observations, enabling policies to compensate for asynchronous reasoning. We further propose a latency-consistent training pipeline that injects reasoning inference delays during imitation learning and online reinforcement learning, aligning training with asynchronous deployment. To support realistic evaluation, we present DynaNav, a physics-accurate, photo-realistic simulation suite for language-guided navigation in dynamic environments. Extensive experiments in simulation and on a real robot show that TIC-VLA consistently outperforms prior VLA models while maintaining robust real-time control under multi-second reasoning latency.",

      "title": "GoodVibe: Security-by-Vibe for LLM-Based Code Generation",
      "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for code generation in fast, informal development workflows, often referred to as vibe coding, where speed and convenience are prioritized, and security requirements are rarely made explicit. In this setting, models frequently produce functionally correct but insecure code, creating a growing security risk. Existing approaches to improving code security rely on full-parameter fine-tuning or parameter-efficient adaptations, which are either costly and prone to catastrophic forgetting or operate at coarse granularity with limited interpretability and control. We present GoodVibe, a neuron-level framework for improving the security of code language models by default. GoodVibe is based on the key insight that security-relevant reasoning is localized to a small subset of neurons. We identify these neurons using gradient-based attribution from a supervised security task and perform neuron-selective fine-tuning that updates only this security-critical subspace. To further reduce training cost, we introduce activation-driven neuron clustering, enabling structured updates with minimal overhead. We evaluate GoodVibe on six LLMs across security-critical programming languages, including C++, Java, Swift, and Go. GoodVibe substantially improves the security of generated code while preserving general model utility, achieving up to a 2.5x improvement over base models, matching or exceeding full fine-tuning with over 4,700x fewer trainable parameters, and reducing training computation by more than 3.6x compared to the parameter-efficient baseline (LoRA). Our results demonstrate that neuron-level optimization offers an effective and scalable approach to securing code generation without sacrificing efficiency or generality.",

      "title": "Large Language Lobotomy: Jailbreaking Mixture-of-Experts via Expert Silencing",
      "abstract": "The rapid adoption of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures marks a major shift in the deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs). MoE LLMs improve scaling efficiency by activating only a small subset of parameters per token, but their routing structure introduces new safety attack surfaces. We find that safety-critical behaviors in MoE LLMs (e.g., refusal) are concentrated in a small set of experts rather than being uniformly distributed. Building on this, we propose Large Language Lobotomy (L), a training-free, architecture-agnostic attack that compromises safety alignment by exploiting expert routing dynamics. L learns routing patterns that correlate with refusal, attributes safety behavior to specific experts, and adaptively silences the most safety-relevant experts until harmful outputs are produced. We evaluate L on eight state-of-the-art open-source MoE LLMs and show that our adaptive expert silencing increases average attack success from 7.3% to 70.4%, reaching up to 86.3%, outperforming prior training-free MoE jailbreak methods. Moreover, bypassing guardrails typically requires silencing fewer than 20% of layer-wise experts while largely preserving general language utility. These results reveal a fundamental tension between efficiency-driven MoE design and robust safety alignment and motivate distributing safety mechanisms more robustly in future MoE LLMs with architecture- and routing-aware methods.",

      "abstract": "The Unrelated Parallel Machine Scheduling Problem (UPMSP) with release dates, setups, and eligibility constraints presents a significant multi-objective challenge. Traditional methods struggle to balance minimizing Total Weighted Tardiness (TWT) and Total Setup Time (TST). This paper proposes a Deep Reinforcement Learning framework using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and a Graph Neural Network (GNN). The GNN effectively represents the complex state of jobs, machines, and setups, allowing the PPO agent to learn a direct scheduling policy. Guided by a multi-objective reward function, the agent simultaneously minimizes TWT and TST. Experimental results on benchmark instances demonstrate that our PPO-GNN agent significantly outperforms a standard dispatching rule and a metaheuristic, achieving a superior trade-off between both objectives. This provides a robust and scalable solution for complex manufacturing scheduling.",

In this paper, we show why traditional feature-attribution methods (e.g., SHAP, LIME) are insufficient for diagnosing failures in tool-using LLM agents. Through experiments on TAU-bench Airline and AssistantBench, we demonstrate that trajectory-level, trace-grounded rubric analysis reliably localizes execution failures such as state inconsistency and incorrect tool selection—where attribution methods cannot. We introduce a unified static vs. agentic explainability taxonomy and propose the Minimal Explanation Packet (MEP) framework for structured, verifiable agent auditing.
