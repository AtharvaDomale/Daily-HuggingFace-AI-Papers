      "abstract": "We study continual skill acquisition in openended embodied environments where an agent must construct, refine, and reuse an expanding library of executable skills. We introduce the Programmatic Skill Network (PSN), a framework in which skills are executable symbolic programs forming a compositional network that evolves through experience. PSN defines three core mechanisms instantiated via large language models: (1) REFLECT for structured fault localization over skill compositions, (2) progressive optimization with maturity-aware update gating that stabilizes reliable skills while maintaining plasticity for uncertain ones, and (3) canonical structural refactoring under rollback validation that maintains network compactness. We further show that PSN’s learning dynamics exhibit structural parallels to neural network training. Experiments on MineDojo and Crafter demonstrate robust skill reuse, rapid adaptation, and strong generalization across open-ended task distributions.",

      "abstract": "🚀 [New Paper] Atlas: Orchestrating Heterogeneous Models and Tools for Multi-Domain Complex Reasoning The growing diversity of LLMs and external tools presents a significant challenge: how to select the optimal model-tool combination for complex reasoning tasks. Existing methods often fall short by relying on single models or fixed tool-calling logic. ATLAS (Adaptive Tool-LLM Alignment and Synergistic Invocation) addresses this by introducing a dual-path framework for dynamic model-tool alignment and invocation across multiple domains. ✨ The Core Intuition: ATLAS employs a dual-path approach to achieve dynamic model-tool alignment and invocation: 1️⃣ Training-Free Cluster-Based Routing: This path leverages empirical priors for domain-specific alignment, efficiently guiding the model-tool selection process. 2️⃣ RL-Based Multi-Step Routing: This path explores autonomous trajectories to achieve strong generalization, particularly for out-of-distribution tasks. 📈 Highlights: Superior Performance: ATLAS significantly outperforms closed-source models like GPT-4o and existing routing methods, achieving +10.1% on in-distribution tasks and +13.1% on out-of-distribution tasks across 15 benchmarks. Enhanced Visual Reasoning: The framework demonstrates substantial improvements in visual reasoning by effectively orchestrating specialized multi-modal tools. Adaptive Orchestration: ATLAS learns to assess its internal state and dynamically invoke external resources, internalizing the alignment between domains and tool utilization. Robust and Generalizable: The design ensures that the routing policy effectively captures expertise distribution, making it robust and generalizable even as tools and models evolve.",

      "abstract": "The rapid proliferation of benchmarks for evaluating large language models (LLMs) has created an urgent need for systematic methods to assess benchmark quality itself. We propose Benchmark^2, a comprehensive framework comprising three complementary metrics: (1) Cross-Benchmark Ranking Consistency, measuring whether a benchmark produces model rankings aligned with peer benchmarks; (2) Discriminability Score, quantifying a benchmark's ability to differentiate between models; and (3) Capability Alignment Deviation, identifying problematic instances where stronger models fail but weaker models succeed within the same model family. We conduct extensive experiments across 15 benchmarks spanning mathematics, reasoning, and knowledge domains, evaluating 11 LLMs across four model families. Our analysis reveals significant quality variations among existing benchmarks and demonstrates that selective benchmark construction based on our metrics can achieve comparable evaluation performance with substantially reduced test sets.",

Instead of blindly scaling computation, the authors formulate multi-task reasoning under a global token constraint as an Ordered Stochastic Multiple-Choice Knapsack Problem, explicitly modeling the trade-off between reasoning cost and expected utility. The proposed two-stage approach combines Meta-Cognitive Fine-Tuning, which enables models to anticipate difficulty and make solve-or-skip decisions before reasoning, with Rationality-Aware Reinforcement Learning, which optimizes long-horizon computation allocation under strict budgets. Across challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks, ROI-Reasoning consistently improves total score and substantially reduces regret—demonstrating that meta-cognitive planning, not just stronger reasoning, is key to efficient test-time scaling of LLMs.",

      "title": "RGS-SLAM: Robust Gaussian Splatting SLAM with One-Shot Dense Initialization",
      "abstract": "We introduce RGS-SLAM, a robust Gaussian-splatting SLAM framework that replaces the residual-driven densification stage of GS-SLAM with a training-free correspondence-to-Gaussian initialization. Instead of progressively adding Gaussians as residuals reveal missing geometry, RGS-SLAM performs a one-shot triangulation of dense multi-view correspondences derived from DINOv3 descriptors refined through a confidence-aware inlier classifier, generating a well-distributed and structure-aware Gaussian seed prior to optimization. This initialization stabilizes early mapping and accelerates convergence by roughly 20%, yielding higher rendering fidelity in texture-rich and cluttered scenes while remaining fully compatible with existing GS-SLAM pipelines. Evaluated on the TUM RGB-D and Replica datasets, RGS-SLAM achieves competitive or superior localization and reconstruction accuracy compared with state-of-the-art Gaussian and point-based SLAM systems, sustaining real-time mapping performance at up to 925 FPS.",
