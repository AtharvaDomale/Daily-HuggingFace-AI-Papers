      "title": "Arbitrage: Efficient Reasoning via Advantage-Aware Speculation",
      "abstract": "Modern large language models achieve impressive reasoning capabilities with long chains of thought, but they incur substantial computational cost at inference time. Speculative decoding improves efficiency by using a fast, less accurate draft model to propose tokens that are then verified in parallel by a stronger target model. However, on reasoning tasks, traditional token-level speculative decoding often rejects many semantically valid steps due to superficial token mismatches. Recent step-level semantic verification methods mitigate this by accepting or rejecting entire reasoning steps, but they still waste target compute by regenerating many rejected steps that yield little quality gain. We propose ARBITRAGE , a step-level speculative generation framework that dynamically routes generation based on the relative advantage of the target model over the draft model. Instead of relying on a fixed acceptance threshold, ARBITRAGE uses a lightweight router trained to predict when the target model is likely to produce a meaningfully better step. This routing approximates an ideal “arbitrage oracle” that always selects the higher-quality step, achieving near-optimal efficiency–accuracy trade-offs. Across multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, ARBITRAGE consistently outperforms prior step-level speculative decoding baselines, reducing inference latency by up to approximately 2× at matched accuracy.",

      "abstract": "Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are expected to jointly interpret vision, audio, and language, yet existing video benchmarks rarely assess fine-grained reasoning about human speech. Many tasks remain visually solvable or only coarsely evaluate speech, offering limited insight into whether models can align who speaks, what is said, and when it occurs. We introduce AV-SpeakerBench, a curated benchmark of 3,212 multiple-choice questions focused on speaker-centric audiovisual reasoning in real-world videos. It features: (1) a speaker-centered formulation that treats speakers-not scenes-as the core reasoning unit; (2) fusion-grounded question design embedding audiovisual dependencies into question semantics; and (3) expert-curated annotations ensuring temporal precision and cross-modal validity. Comprehensive evaluations show that the Gemini family consistently outperforms open-source systems, with Gemini 2.5 Pro achieving the best results. Among open models, Qwen3-Omni-30B approaches Gemini 2.0 Flash but remains far behind Gemini 2.5 Pro, primarily due to weaker audiovisual fusion rather than visual perception. We believe AV-SpeakerBench establishes a rigorous foundation for advancing fine-grained audiovisual reasoning in future multimodal systems.",

      "abstract": "Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have given rise to powerful coding agents, making it possible for code assistants to evolve into code engineers. However, existing methods still face significant challenges in achieving high-fidelity document-to-codebase synthesis--such as scientific papers to code--primarily due to a fundamental conflict between information overload and the context bottlenecks of LLMs. In this work, we introduce DeepCode, a fully autonomous framework that fundamentally addresses this challenge through principled information-flow management. By treating repository synthesis as a channel optimization problem, DeepCode seamlessly orchestrates four information operations to maximize task-relevant signals under finite context budgets: source compression via blueprint distillation, structured indexing using stateful code memory, conditional knowledge injection via retrieval-augmented generation, and closed-loop error correction. Extensive evaluations on the PaperBench benchmark demonstrate that DeepCode achieves state-of-the-art performance, decisively outperforming leading commercial agents such as Cursor and Claude Code, and crucially, surpassing PhD-level human experts from top institutes on key reproduction metrics. By systematically transforming paper specifications into production-grade implementations comparable to human expert quality, this work establishes new foundations for autonomous scientific reproduction that can accelerate research evaluation and discovery.",

We introduce \\textbf{TreeGRPO}, a novel RL framework that dramatically improves training efficiency by recasting the denoising process as a search tree. From shared initial noise samples, TreeGRPO strategically branches to generate multiple candidate trajectories while efficiently reusing their common prefixes. This tree-structured approach delivers three key advantages: (1) \\emph{High sample efficiency}, achieving better performance under same training samples (2) \\emph{Fine-grained credit assignment} via reward backpropagation that computes step-specific advantages, overcoming the uniform credit assignment limitation of trajectory-based methods, and (3) \\emph{Amortized computation} where multi-child branching enables multiple policy updates per forward pass. Extensive experiments on both diffusion and flow-based models demonstrate that TreeGRPO achieves \\textbf{2.4× faster training} while establishing a superior Pareto frontier in the efficiency-reward trade-off space. Our method consistently outperforms GRPO baselines across multiple benchmarks and reward models, providing a scalable and effective pathway for RL-based visual generative model alignment.",

      "abstract": "Monocular 3D tracking aims to capture the long-term motion of pixels in 3D space from a single monocular video and has witnessed rapid progress in recent years. However, we argue that the existing monocular 3D tracking methods still fall short in separating the camera motion from foreground dynamic motion and cannot densely track newly emerging dynamic subjects in the videos. To address these two limitations, we propose TrackingWorld, a novel pipeline for dense 3D tracking of almost all pixels within a world-centric 3D coordinate system. First, we introduce a tracking upsampler that efficiently lifts the arbitrary sparse 2D tracks into dense 2D tracks. Then, to generalize the current tracking methods to newly emerging objects, we apply the upsampler to all frames and reduce the redundancy of 2D tracks by eliminating the tracks in overlapped regions. Finally, we present an efficient optimization-based framework to back-project dense 2D tracks into world-centric 3D trajectories by estimating the camera poses and the 3D coordinates of these 2D tracks. Extensive evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our system achieves accurate and dense 3D tracking in a world-centric coordinate frame.",

      "title": "Novel Deep Learning Architectures for Classification and Segmentation of Brain Tumors from MRI Images",
      "abstract": "We are excited to share our new work tackling the critical challenge of brain tumor detection from MRI scans. Due to high data volume and generalization issues in existing systems, we developed two novel deep learning architectures: SAETCN (Self-Attention Enhancement Tumor Classification Network): A classification model achieving a state-of-the-art 99.38% validation accuracy in classifying four classes (glioma, meningioma, pituitary, and non-tumor). Its self-attention mechanism significantly improves generalization and robustness, overcoming common pitfalls in CAD systems. SAS-Net (Self-Attentive Segmentation Network): For precise tumor localization, achieving 99.23% overall pixel accuracy in segmentation. This paper proposes one of the most accurate and generalized DL architectures for early, automatic brain tumor detection. We hope this work can serve as a strong baseline for future Computer-Aided Diagnosis systems. Check out the paper, and we welcome your feedback and discussions! #MedicalImaging #DeepLearning #SelfAttention #CAD #BrainTumor",
