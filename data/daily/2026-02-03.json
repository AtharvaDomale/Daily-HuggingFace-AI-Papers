In a real-world deployment to cybersecurity, where no prior RLVR data exists, Golden Goose synthesizes RLVR tasks from raw FineWeb scrapes, yielding a new SoTA 4B cybersecurity LLM that surpasses a 7B domain-specialized model .",

      "abstract": "Our analysis revealed a phenomenon we term Manifold Realignment. RLVR is a Trajectory Optimizer : We found that RLVR irreversibly reorganizes the local geometry of the latent manifold but largely preserves the global manifold geometry (the overall map of knowledge) and the linear readout of base models. Coordinate basis will alter substantially and reversibly only under prolonged RLVR. Contrastive Learning acts as an Equalizer : When we fine-tune these models to embedding models, the contrastive loss forces the base and reasoning models to align strongly again. The Takeaway for Practitioners: Our results suggest that the \"reasoning\" capability in current models is a learned policy for navigating the latent manifold , rather than a fundamental restructuring of the knowledge map itself. As latent-space-centric paradigms such as World Models and JEPA gain prominence, our findings point to a practical trade-off: RLVR tends to preserve the base model’s representational backbone (which may help retain broad generalization), yet on its own is unlikely to fundamentally improve the underlying global organization of the latent manifold. If RLVR’s distinctive footprint is local geometry reorganization under global geometry stability, then similar behavior might be achievable via SFT augmented with geometry- and basis-aware regularization .",

In this work, we delve into the inherent spectral characteristics of dLLMs and present the first frequency-domain analysis showing that low-frequency components in hidden states primarily encode global structural information and long-range dependencies, while high-frequency components are responsible for characterizing local details. Based on this observation, we propose FourierSampler, which leverages a frequency-domain sliding window mechanism to dynamically guide the model to achieve a \"structure-to-detail\" generation. FourierSampler outperforms other inference enhancement strategies on LLADA and SDAR, achieving relative improvements of 20.4% on LLaDA1.5-8B and 16.0% on LLaDA-8B-Instruct. It notably surpasses similarly sized autoregressive models like Llama3.1-8B-Instruct. Code is available at https://github.com/ShirleYoung/FourierSampler .",

      "title": "DreamActor-M2: Universal Character Image Animation via Spatiotemporal In-Context Learning",
      "abstract": "Character image animation aims to synthesize high-fidelity videos by transferring motion from a driving sequence to a static reference image. Despite recent advancements, existing methods suffer from two fundamental challenges: (1) suboptimal motion injection strategies that lead to a trade-off between identity preservation and motion consistency, manifesting as a \"see-saw\", and (2) an over-reliance on explicit pose priors (e.g., skeletons), which inadequately capture intricate dynamics and hinder generalization to arbitrary, non-humanoid characters. To address these challenges, we present DreamActor-M2, a universal animation framework that reimagines motion conditioning as an in-context learning problem. Our approach follows a two-stage paradigm. First, we bridge the input modality gap by fusing reference appearance and motion cues into a unified latent space, enabling the model to jointly reason about spatial identity and temporal dynamics by leveraging the generative prior of foundational models. Second, we introduce a self-bootstrapped data synthesis pipeline that curates pseudo cross-identity training pairs, facilitating a seamless transition from pose-dependent control to direct, end-to-end RGB-driven animation. This strategy significantly enhances generalization across diverse characters and motion scenarios. To facilitate comprehensive evaluation, we further introduce AW Bench, a versatile benchmark encompassing a wide spectrum of characters types and motion scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DreamActor-M2 achieves state-of-the-art performance, delivering superior visual fidelity and robust cross-domain generalization.

This work is motivated by the high computational cost of traditional compile-and-run validation in automated test generation, especially when using large language models (LLMs) for code tasks. RM-RF is trained on a multilingual dataset across Java, Python, and Go that pairs code + test files with execution-derived labels, and various model families and tuning regimes (zero-shot, fine-tuned, PEFT/LoRA) achieve ~0.69 F1 on the three targets. Key contributions include: a scalable “run-free” reward model that reduces latency and infrastructure needs compared to execution-based evaluation, a curated dataset and methodology for comparative assessment of unit test quality signals, empirical analysis of RM-RF with different model sizes and fine-tuning strategies. This approach can provide rapid feedback for large-scale test generation and RL-based code optimization, bridging a gap between high-fidelity execution feedback and scalable automated unit test evaluation.",

      "abstract": "🧪 TAM-Eval: Evaluating LLMs for Automated Unit Test Maintenance What’s new: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely explored for unit test generation , but real-world test suite maintenance — like creating, updating, and repairing tests as code evolves — hasn’t been systematically evaluated. This paper introduces TAM-Eval , the benchmark and evaluation framework that targets exactly these maintenance tasks in realistic software contexts. Core contributions: 🔹 Benchmark and framework: TAM-Eval evaluates LLMs on three maintenance scenarios — creation , repair , and updating of test suites — at the test file level with actual context (not isolated function snippets). 🔹 Real-world dataset: The benchmark is built from 1,539 automatically extracted and validated scenarios from open-source projects in Python, Java, and Go. 🔹 Evaluation metrics: Instead of simple accuracy scores, the framework uses reference-free metrics reflecting real software quality: Test suite pass rate Code coverage change Mutation testing outcomes These align closer to developer goals in maintenance. 🔹 Empirical results: State-of-the-art LLMs show only limited improvements on realistic maintenance workflows — indicating that current models still struggle with practical test suite evolution. Why it matters: Automated testing and maintenance are essential for high-quality software. Most benchmarks have focused on test generation at function level; TAM-Eval shifts the focus to maintenance workflows developers actually deal with , providing a new community standard for evaluating LLMs in software engineering contexts. Open science: The TAM-Eval code and dataset are fully open-source, enabling future research and direct integration into evaluation pipelines.",

      "abstract": "🚀 New Research Alert! 🧠✨ We’re excited to share our latest work: Deep Search with Hierarchical Meta-Cognitive Monitoring Inspired by Cognitive Neuroscience 🔍 What’s the key idea? Deep search agents powered by LLMs excel at multi-step reasoning and retrieval—but they often fail silently when small errors accumulate under uncertainty. Drawing direct inspiration from human cognitive neuroscience , we propose a hierarchical meta-cognitive monitoring framework that mirrors how humans detect anomalies, reflect on mistakes, and adapt their behavior during complex problem solving. 🧠 Neuroscience-inspired design Human metacognition is not monolithic: it combines fast, automatic error signals with slower, experience-driven reflection . We translate this principle into deep search agents via two complementary monitors: 🧩 Our approach introduces two complementary monitors: ⚡ Fast Consistency Monitor Inspired by rapid neural mechanisms for conflict and surprise detection (e.g., early mismatch and uncertainty signals), this module performs lightweight, always-on checks to detect misalignment between external evidence and internal reasoning confidence . 🐢 Slow Experience-Driven Monitor Inspired by higher-order reflective processes and memory-based control in the human brain, this module is selectively activated . It leverages experience from past trajectories to guide deliberate correction and strategic adjustment. 📈 Why does this matter? By embedding neuroscience-inspired meta-cognitive monitoring directly into the ReAct loop of a Deep Search Agent, our framework: Enhances robustness and reliability in long-horizon reasoning Enables early detection and correction of cascading errors Establishes a tighter conceptual bridge between human metacognition and agentic AI system design 🧪 Results Experiments across multiple deep search benchmarks and backbone models demonstrate consistent improvements in both performance and robustness , validating the effectiveness of this cognitively grounded design.",

      "abstract": "RLHF is central to aligning LLMs with human preferences, but it often suffers from reward overoptimization: the policy learns to game the reward model instead of truly following human intent. A key reason? Distribution shift—the policy keeps changing, while the reward model stays static. R2M (Real-Time Aligned Reward Model) tackles this head-on. Instead of relying only on fixed semantic features, R2M feeds on the policy’s evolving hidden states, aligning the reward model in real time with the policy’s trajectory during RL. 🔑 Takeaway: Reward models shouldn’t be passive judges. They should co-evolve with the policy.",

      "abstract": "End-to-end autonomous driving increasingly leverages self-supervised video pretraining to learn transferable planning representations. However, pretraining video world models for scene understanding has so far brought only limited improvements. This limitation is compounded by the inherent ambiguity of driving: each scene typically provides only a single human trajectory, making it difficult to learn multimodal behaviors. In this work, we propose Drive-JEPA, a framework that integrates Video Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (V-JEPA) with multimodal trajectory distillation for end-to-end driving. First, we adapt V-JEPA for end-to-end driving, pretraining a ViT encoder on large-scale driving videos to produce predictive representations aligned with trajectory planning. Second, we introduce a proposal-centric planner that distills diverse simulator-generated trajectories alongside human trajectories, with a momentum-aware selection mechanism to promote stable and safe behavior. When evaluated on NAVSIM, the V-JEPA representation combined with a simple transformer-based decoder outperforms prior methods by 3 PDMS in the perception-free setting. The complete Drive-JEPA framework achieves 93.3 PDMS on v1 and 87.8 EPDMS on v2, setting a new state-of-the-art.",

      "abstract": "Open-vocabulary grounding requires accurate vision-language alignment under weak supervision, yet existing methods either rely on global sentence embeddings that lack fine-grained expressiveness or introduce token-level alignment with explicit supervision or heavy cross-attention designs. We propose ExpAlign, a theoretically grounded vision-language alignment framework built on a principled multiple instance learning formulation. ExpAlign introduces an Expectation Alignment Head that performs attentionbased soft MIL pooling over token-region similarities, enabling implicit token and instance selection without additional annotations. To further stabilize alignment learning, we develop an energy-based multi-scale consistency regularization scheme, including a Top-K multi-positive contrastive objective and a Geometry-Aware Consistency Objective derived from a Lagrangianconstrained free-energy minimization. Extensive experiments show that ExpAlign consistently improves open-vocabulary detection and zero-shot instance segmentation, particularly on long-tail categories. Most notably, it achieves 36.2 APron the LVIS minival split, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods at comparable model scale, while remaining lightweight and inference efficient.",

      "abstract": "We’re entering the age of research, not just the age of scaling. Bigger models gave us horsepower. But pretraining still has almost no steering wheel. Today’s foundation models learn in an open loop: pick a proxy objective (next‑token / fixed augmentations) → burn trillions of tokens → hope the capabilities we care about “emerge”. That hope is getting expensive. If the “AGI won’t happen from brute-force scaling” camp is even partly right, then the bottleneck is clear: value per gradient step. So we asked a practical question: Can a small amount of verified goal information steer the massive unlabeled pretraining phase—without turning pretraining into supervised finetuning? A potential answer: V‑Pretraining (Value‑Based Pre‑Training with Downstream Feedback). https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22108 . Idea: add a lightweight task designer that reshapes the self‑supervised task so each unlabeled update is more useful downstream.",

      "title": "KAPSO: A Knowledge-grounded framework for Autonomous Program Synthesis and Optimization",
      "abstract": "We introduce KAPSO, a modular framework for autonomous program synthesis and optimization. Given a natural language goal and an evaluation method, KAPSO iteratively performs ideation, code synthesis and editing, execution, evaluation, and learning to improve a runnable artifact toward measurable objectives. Rather than treating synthesis as the endpoint, KAPSO uses synthesis as an operator within a long-horizon optimization loop, where progress is defined by evaluator outcomes. KAPSO targets long-horizon failures common in coding agents, including lost experimental state, brittle debugging, and weak reuse of domain expertise, by integrating three tightly coupled components. First, a git-native experimentation engine isolates each attempt as a branch, producing reproducible artifacts and preserving provenance across iterations. Second, a knowledge system ingests heterogeneous sources, including repositories, internal playbooks, and curated external resources such as documentation, scientific papers, and web search results, and organizes them into a structured representation that supports retrieval over workflows, implementations, and environment constraints. Third, a cognitive memory layer coordinates retrieval and maintains an episodic store of reusable lessons distilled from experiment traces (run logs, diffs, and evaluator feedback), reducing repeated error modes and accelerating convergence. We evaluated KAPSO on MLE-Bench (Kaggle-style ML competitions) and ALE-Bench (AtCoder heuristic optimization), and report end-to-end performance.
