      "abstract": "Current Vision–Language–Action (VLA) models rely on fixed computational depth, expending the same amount of compute on simple adjustments and complex multi-step manipulation. While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting enables variable computation, it scales memory linearly and is ill-suited for continuous action spaces. We introduce Recurrent-Depth VLA (RD-VLA), an architecture that achieves computational adaptivity via latent iterative refinement rather than explicit token generation. RD-VLA employs a recurrent, weight-tied action head that supports arbitrary inference depth with a constant memory footprint. The model is trained using truncated backpropagation through time (TBPTT) to efficiently supervise the refinement process. At inference, RD-VLA dynamically allocates compute using an adaptive stopping criterion based on latent convergence. Experiments on challenging manipulation tasks show that recurrent depth is critical: tasks that fail entirely (0% success) with single-iteration inference exceed 90% success with four iterations, while simpler tasks saturate rapidly. RD-VLA provides a scalable path to test-time compute in robotics, replacing token-based reasoning with latent reasoning to achieve constant memory usage and up to 80× inference speedup over prior reasoning-based VLA models.",

      "abstract": "Deploying GRPO on Flow Matching models has proven effective for text-to-image generation. However, existing paradigms typically propagate an outcome-based reward to all preceding denoising steps without distinguishing the local effect of each step. Moreover, current group-wise ranking mainly compares trajectories at matched timesteps and ignores within-trajectory dependencies, where certain early denoising actions can affect later states via delayed, implicit interactions. We propose TurningPoint-GRPO (TP-GRPO), a GRPO framework that alleviates step-wise reward sparsity and explicitly models long-term effects within the denoising trajectory. TP-GRPO makes two key innovations: (i) it replaces outcome-based rewards with step-level incremental rewards, providing a dense, step-aware learning signal that better isolates each denoising action's \"pure\" effect, and (ii) it identifies turning points-steps that flip the local reward trend and make subsequent reward evolution consistent with the overall trajectory trend-and assigns these actions an aggregated long-term reward to capture their delayed impact. Turning points are detected solely via sign changes in incremental rewards, making TP-GRPO efficient and hyperparameter-free. Extensive experiments also demonstrate that TP-GRPO exploits reward signals more effectively and consistently improves generation.",

      "abstract": "Recent advancements in image generation models have enabled the prediction of future Graphical User Interface (GUI) states based on user instructions. However, existing benchmarks primarily focus on general domain visual fidelity, leaving the evaluation of state transitions and temporal coherence in GUI-specific contexts underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce GEBench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating dynamic interaction and temporal coherence in GUI generation. GEBench comprises 700 carefully curated samples spanning five task categories, covering both single-step interactions and multi-step trajectories across real-world and fictional scenarios, as well as grounding point localization. To support systematic evaluation, we propose GE-Score, a novel five-dimensional metric that assesses Goal Achievement, Interaction Logic, Content Consistency, UI Plausibility, and Visual Quality. Extensive evaluations on current models indicate that while they perform well on single-step transitions, they struggle significantly with maintaining temporal coherence and spatial grounding over longer interaction sequences. Our findings identify icon interpretation, text rendering, and localization precision as critical bottlenecks. This work provides a foundation for systematic assessment and suggests promising directions for future research toward building high-fidelity generative GUI environments.

      "title": "Learning Query-Aware Budget-Tier Routing for Runtime Agent Memory",
      "abstract": "Memory is increasingly central to Large Language Model (LLM) agents operating beyond a single context window, yet most existing systems rely on offline, query-agnostic memory construction that can be inefficient and may discard query-critical information. Although runtime memory utilization is a natural alternative, prior work often incurs substantial overhead and offers limited explicit control over the performance-cost trade-off. In this work, we present BudgetMem, a runtime agent memory framework for explicit, query-aware performance-cost control. BudgetMem structures memory processing as a set of memory modules, each offered in three budget tiers (i.e., Low/Mid/High). A lightweight router performs budget-tier routing across modules to balance task performance and memory construction cost, which is implemented as a compact neural policy trained with reinforcement learning. Using BudgetMem as a unified testbed, we study three complementary strategies for realizing budget tiers: implementation (method complexity), reasoning (inference behavior), and capacity (module model size). Across LoCoMo, LongMemEval, and HotpotQA, BudgetMem surpasses strong baselines when performance is prioritized (i.e., high-budget setting), and delivers better accuracy-cost frontiers under tighter budgets. Moreover, our analysis disentangles the strengths and weaknesses of different tiering strategies, clarifying when each axis delivers the most favorable trade-offs under varying budget regimes.",

      "abstract": "Theory of Space studies whether foundation models can construct a globally consistent spatial belief from partial observations via active exploration, revise the belief in dynamic environments when new evidence contradicts prior assumptions, and exploit the belief for downstream spatial tasks. We also probe the model to externalize its spatial belief during exploration to “open the box” and directly observe how beliefs evolve over time.",

Data: We collected a new dataset of reasoning trajectories from symbolic tasks to focus purely on logic, stripping away the distraction of real-world knowledge. Method: We tested various ways to induce these skills intoLLMs, ranging from simple fine-tuning to more advanced structural changes like Mixture-of-Experts (MoE). Result: Focusing on these fundamental paradigms led to significant performance boosts (up to 14.60 points) when the models were tested on real-world, natural language tasks they hadn't seen before.",

To address the scarcity of high-fidelity training data and the distributional mismatch where models struggle to recover from their own mistakes, the framework employs two key phases: Environment Synthesis: It uses a multi-agent refinement loop to generate diverse, functionally valid tasks and verifiable Docker containers. Trajectory Collection: It utilizes a Generator-Critic protocol that actively injects errors into trajectories to teach models how to diagnose and recover from runtime failures. The resulting model, TermiGen-Qwen2.5-Coder-32B, achieves a state-of-the-art 31.3% pass rate on TerminalBench, outperforming existing open-source baselines and even surpassing proprietary models like GPT-4o-mini.",

      "abstract": "Solving open-ended science questions remains challenging for large language models, particularly due to inherently unreliable supervision and evaluation. The bottleneck lies in the data construction and reward design for scientific post-training. We develop a large-scale, systematic data processing pipeline that transforms heterogeneous open-source science data into Dr. SCI dataset, which comprises of 1M questions across eight STEM subjects, with explicit verifiable/open-ended splits, scalable difficulty annotation, and fine-grained rubrics that operationalize evaluation for open-ended answers. Building on this dataset, we propose the Dr. SCI post-training pipeline, which redesigns the standard SFT -> RL workflow through three components: (i) Exploration-Expanding SFT, which broadens the model's reasoning pattern coverage prior to RL; (ii) Dynamic Difficulty Curriculum, which adapts training data to the model's evolving scientific capability; and (iii) SciRubric-Guided RL, which enables stable reinforcement learning on open-ended scientific questions via rubric-based evaluation with explicit answer correctness. Qwen3-4B-Base trained using Dr. SCI pipeline achieves 63.2 on GPQA-diamond and 32.4 on GPQA-general, consistently improves over strong post-trained baselines such as o1-mini and GPT-4o, demonstrating substantial gains in scientific reasoning, especially in open-ended settings.",

      "abstract": "While recent years have witnessed rapid progress in speech synthesis, open-source singing voice synthesis (SVS) systems still face significant barriers to industrial deployment, particularly in terms of robustness and zero-shot generalization. In this report, we introduce SoulX-Singer, a high-quality open-source SVS system designed with practical deployment considerations in mind. SoulX-Singer supports controllable singing generation conditioned on either symbolic musical scores (MIDI) or melodic representations, enabling flexible and expressive control in real-world production workflows. Trained on more than 42,000 hours of vocal data, the system supports Mandarin Chinese, English, and Cantonese and consistently achieves state-of-the-art synthesis quality across languages under diverse musical conditions. Furthermore, to enable reliable evaluation of zero-shot SVS performance in practical scenarios, we construct SoulX-Singer-Eval, a dedicated benchmark with strict training-test disentanglement, facilitating systematic assessment in zero-shot settings.",

We found that SWE-Bench-Verified scores can vary by 2.2 to 6.0 percentage points, making small improvements hard to distinguish from noise. Read more at: https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07150",

      "abstract": "Tokenization is a pivotal design choice for morphologically rich languages like Turkish, where productive agglutination strains both vocabulary efficiency and morphological fidelity. Despite growing interest, prior work often varies vocabulary size without controlling the tokenizer’s training corpus, offers sparse intrinsic diagnostics, and tests a narrow band of downstream tasks. We present the first comprehensive, principled study of Turkish subword tokenization—a “subwords manifest”—that jointly varies vocabulary and corpus size, compares multiple tokenizer families under matched budgets (WordPiece, morphology‑level, and character baselines), and evaluates broadly across semantic, syntactic, and morphology‑sensitive probes. To explain why tokenizers succeed or fail, we introduce a morphology‑aware diagnostic toolkit that moves beyond coarse aggregates to boundary‑level F1, lemma atomicity vs. surface boundary hits, over/under‑segmentation indices, edit distances (CER/WER), continuation rates, and affix‑type coverage and atomicity. Our contributions deliver a systematic analysis of the vocabulary–corpus–success triad, a unified evaluation framework linking intrinsic diagnostics to extrinsic outcomes, controlled comparisons that identify when character‑ and morphology‑level tokenization pay off, and an open‑source release of code, pipelines, and models for reproducible research.",

      "abstract": "GraphAgents: Knowledge Graph-Guided Agentic AI for Cross-Domain Materials Design Large Language Models (LLMs) promise to accelerate discovery by reasoning across the expanding scientific landscape. Yet, the challenge is no longer access to information but connecting it in meaningful, domain-spanning ways. In materials science, where innovation demands integrating concepts from molecular chemistry to mechanical performance, this is especially acute. Neither humans nor single-agent LLMs can fully contend with this torrent of information, with the latter often prone to hallucinations. To address this bottleneck, we introduce a multi-agent framework guided by large-scale knowledge graphs to find sustainable substitutes for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS)-chemicals currently under intense regulatory scrutiny. Agents in the framework specialize in problem decomposition, evidence retrieval, design parameter extraction, and graph traversal, uncovering latent connections across distinct knowledge pockets to support hypothesis generation. Ablation studies show that the full multi-agent pipeline outperforms single-shot prompting, underscoring the value of distributed specialization and relational reasoning. We demonstrate that by tailoring graph traversal strategies, the system alternates between exploitative searches focusing on domain-critical outcomes and exploratory searches surfacing emergent cross-connections. Illustrated through the exemplar of biomedical tubing, the framework generates sustainable PFAS-free alternatives that balance tribological performance, thermal stability, chemical resistance, and biocompatibility. This work establishes a framework combining knowledge graphs with multi-agent reasoning to expand the materials design space, showcasing several initial design candidates to demonstrate the approach.",

To this end, Anchored Decoding is a decoding technique for language models (LMs) that provably reduces the likelihood of generating copyrighted text. It requires two LMs: a safe model trained exclusively on permissively licensed data, and a risky model that is higher-utility and trained on mixed-licensed data. Anchored Decoding works for both token-level and byte-level decoding. To make this algorithm as practical as possible, we release (1) TinyLlama 1.8B , a safe base LM that is tokenizer-compatible with the Llama 3 model family, and (2) byte-level support to facilitate mixed-tokenizer decoding.",

      "abstract": "Simulating collective animal behavior requires robust tools to capture emergent complexity. This paper introduces dewi-kadita, an open-source Python library that implements the three-dimensional Couzin model for fish schooling. Unlike traditional tools that rely solely on polarization and rotation order parameters, this library introduces a suite of seven entropy-based metrics combined into a single Oceanic Schooling Index (OSI) to rigorously quantify collective disorder and differentiate between complex states like milling tori and dynamic parallel groups.",

      "abstract": "Universal Multimodal Retrieval (UMR) seeks any-to-any search across text and vision, yet modern embedding models remain brittle when queries require latent reasoning (e.g., resolving underspecified references or matching compositional constraints). We argue this brittleness is often data-induced: when images carry \"silent\" evidence and queries leave key semantics implicit, a single embedding pass must both reason and compress, encouraging spurious feature matching. We propose a data-centric framework that decouples these roles by externalizing reasoning before retrieval. Using a strong Vision--Language Model, we make implicit semantics explicit by densely captioning visual evidence in corpus entries, resolving ambiguous multimodal references in queries, and rewriting verbose instructions into concise retrieval constraints. Inference-time enhancement alone is insufficient; the retriever must be trained on these semantically dense representations to avoid distribution shift and fully exploit the added signal. Across M-BEIR, our reasoning-augmented training method yields consistent gains over strong baselines, with ablations showing that corpus enhancement chiefly benefits knowledge-intensive queries while query enhancement is critical for compositional modification requests.",

      "abstract": "Recent research shows that Preference Alignment (PA) objectives act as divergence estimators be- tween aligned (chosen) and unaligned (rejected) response distributions. In this work, we extend this divergence-based perspective to general align- ment settings, such as reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), where only environ- mental rewards are available. Within this unified framework, we propose f-Group Relative Policy Optimization (f-GRPO), a class of on-policy re- inforcement learning, and f-Hybrid Alignment Loss (f-HAL), a hybrid on/off policy objectives, for general LLM alignment based on variational representation of f-divergences. We provide the- oretical guarantees that these classes of objec- tives improve the average reward after alignment. Empirically, we validate our framework on both RLVR (Math Reasoning) and PA tasks (Safety Alignment), demonstrating superior performance and flexibility compared to current methods.",

      "abstract": "We present the first comprehensive Lean 4 formalization of statistical learning theory (SLT) grounded in empirical process theory. Our end-to-end formal infrastructure implement the missing contents in latest Lean library, including a complete development of Gaussian Lipschitz concentration, the first formalization of Dudley’s entropy integral theorem for sub-Gaussian processes, and an application to least-squares regression with a sharp rate. The project was carried out using a human–AI collaborative workflow, in which humans design proof strategies and AI agents execute tactical proof construction, resulting in approximately 30,000 lines of human-verified Lean 4 code produced over 500 hours of supervised development. Beyond implementation, the formalization process exposes and resolves implicit assumptions and missing details in standard SLT textbooks, enforcing a granular, line-by-line understanding of the theory. This work establishes a reusable formal foundation for future developments in machine learning theory. The code is available at https://github.com/YuanheZ/lean-stat-learning-theory",
