      "abstract": "TL;DR: Scaling VLA isn’t enough—you need quality-aligned trajectories + a unified action interface + staged RL refinement to get reliable cross-robot generalization. This work (1) introduces a unified R64 action space with a fixed semantic layout plus embodiment/control-type prompts and a masked BC loss so unused DoFs don’t inject spurious gradients, (2) normalizes heterogeneous demonstration speeds via optical-flow–based temporal resampling to align motion statistics across datasets, and (3) follows a staged recipe R0 → R1 → R2, where R2 RL alignment explicitly targets long-horizon consistency and error recovery. On real bimanual table cleaning (ALOHA), it reaches 69.5% first-item success vs 35.6% for the baseline and is ~2× faster (1m35s vs 2m59s). On Simpler (Google Robot), performance improves from 60.2 (R0) to 71.8 (R2). A nice practical touch: an episode-end prediction head reduces “post-success fidgeting” that can flip successes into failures.

      "abstract": "Current repository agents encounter a reasoning disconnect due to fragmented representations, as existing methods rely on isolated API documentation or dependency graphs that lack semantic depth. We consider repository comprehension and generation to be inverse processes within a unified cycle: generation expands intent into implementation, while comprehension compresses implementation back into intent. To address this, we propose RPG-Encoder, a framework that generalizes the Repository Planning Graph (RPG) from a static generative blueprint into a unified, high-fidelity representation. RPG-Encoder closes the reasoning loop through three mechanisms: (1) Encoding raw code into the RPG that combines lifted semantic features with code dependencies; (2) Evolving the topology incrementally to decouple maintenance costs from repository scale, reducing overhead by 95.7%; and (3) Operating as a unified interface for structure-aware navigation. In evaluations, RPG-Encoder establishes state-of-the-art repository understanding on SWE-bench Verified with 93.7% Acc@5 and exceeds the best baseline by over 10% on SWE-bench Live Lite. These results highlight our superior fine-grained localization accuracy in complex codebases. Furthermore, it achieves 98.5% reconstruction coverage on RepoCraft, confirming RPG’s high-fidelity capacity to mirror the original codebase and closing the loop between intent and implementation.",

      "abstract": "Pixel diffusion generates images directly in pixel space in an end-to-end manner, avoiding the artifacts and bottlenecks introduced by VAEs in two-stage latent diffusion. However, it is challenging to optimize high-dimensional pixel manifolds that contain many perceptually irrelevant signals, leaving existing pixel diffusion methods lagging behind latent diffusion models. We propose PixelGen, a simple pixel diffusion framework with perceptual supervision. Instead of modeling the full image manifold, PixelGen introduces two complementary perceptual losses to guide diffusion model towards learning a more meaningful perceptual manifold. An LPIPS loss facilitates learning better local patterns, while a DINO-based perceptual loss strengthens global semantics. With perceptual supervision, PixelGen surpasses strong latent diffusion baselines. It achieves an FID of 5.11 on ImageNet-256 without classifier-free guidance using only 80 training epochs, and demonstrates favorable scaling performance on large-scale text-to-image generation with a GenEval score of 0.79. PixelGen requires no VAEs, no latent representations, and no auxiliary stages, providing a simpler yet more powerful generative paradigm.

      "abstract": "A good objective for supervised post-training is commonly taken as one that optimizes for performance after supervised stage. But when this supervised stage is followed by an online RL stage,  SFT stage gains may not be preserved after online RL .  This paper experiments with a variety of supervised objectives, and finds that the out-of-the-box performance of these objectives often change after subsequent RL. This highlights a mismatch between these two goals. This paper proposes a reweighing mechanism for standard supervised losses designed to weigh each token using the effect of learning on that token on RL stage. This paper presents an approach based inspired by off-policy evaluation to compute weights based on the likelihood of continuation from each starting point. The paper includes multiple practical variants based on that principle and demonstrates the effectiveness.",

      "abstract": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable success in open-vocabulary perceptual tasks, yet their ability to solve complex cognitive problems remains limited, especially when visual details are abstract and require visual memory. Current approaches primarily scale Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in the text space, even when language alone is insufficient for clear and structured reasoning, and largely neglect visual reasoning mechanisms analogous to the human visuospatial sketchpad and visual imagery. To mitigate this deficiency, we introduce Cognitive Supersensing, a novel training paradigm that endows MLLMs with human-like visual imagery capabilities by integrating a Latent Visual Imagery Prediction (LVIP) head that jointly learns sequences of visual cognitive latent embeddings and aligns them with the answer, thereby forming vision-based internal reasoning chains. We further introduce a reinforcement learning stage that optimizes text reasoning paths based on this grounded visual latent. To evaluate the cognitive capabilities of MLLMs, we present CogSense-Bench, a comprehensive visual question answering (VQA) benchmark assessing five cognitive dimensions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MLLMs trained with Cognitive Supersensing significantly outperform state-of-the-art baselines on CogSense-Bench and exhibit superior generalization on out-of-domain mathematics and science VQA benchmarks, suggesting that internal visual imagery is potentially key to bridging the gap between perceptual recognition and cognitive understanding. We will open-source the CogSense-Bench and our model weights.",

We evaluate a diverse set of open-source and proprietary LLMs spanning general-purpose, Japanese-adapted, and financial models. Results show that even state-of-the-art systems struggle on both tasks. While increased model scale yields limited improvements, language- and domain-specific adaptation does not reliably improve performance, leaving substantial gaps unresolved. Ebisu provides a focused benchmark for advancing linguistically and culturally grounded financial NLP. All datasets and evaluation scripts are publicly released.",

      "abstract": "Progressive Learning (PL) reduces pre-training computational overhead by gradually increasing model scale. While prior work has extensively explored depth expansion, width expansion remains significantly understudied, with the few existing methods limited to the early stages of training. However, expanding width during the mid-stage is essential for maximizing computational savings, yet it remains a formidable challenge due to severe training instabilities. Empirically, we show that naive initialization at this stage disrupts activation statistics, triggering loss spikes, while copy-based initialization introduces gradient symmetry that hinders feature diversity. To address these issues, we propose SPARKLING (balancing Signal Preservation And symmetRy breaKing for width-progressive LearnING), a novel framework for mid-stage width expansion. Our method achieves signal preservation via RMS-scale consistency, stabilizing activation statistics during expansion. Symmetry breaking is ensured through asymmetric optimizer state resetting and learning rate re-warmup. Extensive experiments on Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models demonstrate that, across multiple width axes and optimizer families, SPARKLING consistently outperforms training from scratch and reduces training cost by up to 35% under 2× width expansion.",

      "abstract": "Computer-Using Agents (CUAs) aim to autonomously operate computer systems to complete real-world tasks. However, existing agentic systems remain difficult to scale and lag behind human performance. A key limitation is the absence of reusable and structured skill abstractions that capture how humans interact with graphical user interfaces and how to leverage these skills. We introduce CUA-Skill, a computer-using agentic skill base that encodes human computer-use knowledge as skills coupled with parameterized execution and composition graphs. CUA-Skill is a large-scale library of carefully engineered skills spanning common Windows applications, serving as a practical infrastructure and tool substrate for scalable, reliable agent development. Built upon this skill base, we construct CUA-Skill Agent, an end-to-end computer-using agent that supports dynamic skill retrieval, argument instantiation, and memory-aware failure recovery. Our results demonstrate that CUA-Skill substantially improves execution success rates and robustness on challenging end-to-end agent benchmarks, establishing a strong foundation for future computer-using agent development. On WindowsAgentArena, CUA-Skill Agent achieves state-of-the-art 57.5% (best of three) successful rate while being significantly more efficient than prior and concurrent approaches.

      "abstract": "PolySAE: Modeling Feature Interactions via Polynomial Decoding What: We generalize Sparse Autoencoders to capture feature interactions via polynomial decoding while preserving linear, interpretable encodings. Why: Standard SAEs assume features combine additively through linear reconstruction, which conflates compositional concepts with co-occurrence—they can't distinguish whether \"Starbucks\" emerges from composing \"star\" + \"coffee\" features or merely their frequent overlap, forcing monolithic features for compound concepts. How: We extend the decoder with quadratic and cubic terms to model interactions while preserving the linear encoder essential for interpretability. Through low-rank tensor factorization, PolySAE captures pairwise and triple feature interactions with minimal parameter overhead (~3% on GPT-2 Small). Results: Across 4 LLMs and 3 sparsifiers, we achieve an average 8% improvement in probing F1 and 2–10× larger Wasserstein distances between class-conditional distributions, while maintaining comparable reconstruction error. Beyond Co-occurrence: Learned interaction weights show negligible correlation with co-occurrence frequency (r = 0.06 vs. r = 0.82 for SAE feature covariance), suggesting the model captures compositional semantics rather than surface statistics. Interpretable Interactions: Qualitative analysis reveals meaningful interaction patterns with examples \"invest\" + \"-ing\" + \"stock\" → financial contexts, \"star\" + \"coffee\" → Starbucks, or \"nuclear\" + \"test\" + \"radiation\" → weapons testing. Plug-and-Play: PolySAE is a strict generalization of standard SAEs—setting interaction coefficients to zero recovers vanilla behavior—and is compatible with SAE architectures (i.e., TopK, BatchTopK, Matryoshka, etc.).",

To address this limitation, we propose Rubric-ARM, a framework that jointly optimizes a rubric generator and a judge using reinforcement learning from preference feedback. Unlike existing methods that rely on static rubrics or disjoint training pipelines, our approach treats rubric generation as a latent action learned to maximize judgment accuracy. We introduce an alternating optimization strategy to mitigate the non-stationarity of simultaneous updates, providing theoretical analysis that demonstrates how this schedule reduces gradient variance during training.

However, in daily scenarios, the perception of these advanced AI capabilities among general users remains limited. We argue that current evaluations prioritize increasing task difficulty without sufficiently addressing the diversity of agentic tasks necessary to cover the daily work, life, and learning activities of a broad demographic. To address this, we propose AgentIF-OneDay, aimed at determining whether general users can utilize natural language instructions and AI agents to complete a diverse array of daily tasks. These tasks require not only solving problems through dialogue but also understanding various attachment types and delivering tangible file-based results. The benchmark is structured around three user-centric categories: Open Workflow Execution, which assesses adherence to explicit and complex workflows; Latent Instruction, which requires agents to infer implicit instructions from attachments; and Iterative Refinement, which involves modifying or expanding upon ongoing work. We employ instance-level rubrics and a refined evaluation pipeline that aligns LLM-based verification with human judgment, achieving an 80.1% agreement rate using Gemini-3-Pro. AgentIF-OneDay comprises 104 tasks covering 767 scoring points. We benchmarked four leading general AI agents and found that agent products built based on APIs and ChatGPT agents based on agent RL remain in the first tier simultaneously. Leading LLM APIs and open-source models have internalized agentic capabilities, enabling AI application teams to develop cutting-edge Agent products.",

However, existing automated question synthesis methods lack precise difficulty control, incur high computational costs, and struggle to generate competition-level questions at scale. In this paper, we propose CoDiQ (Controllable Difficult Question Generation), a novel framework enabling fine-grained difficulty control via test-time scaling while ensuring question solvability. Specifically, first, we identify a test-time scaling tendency (extended reasoning token budget boosts difficulty but reduces solvability) and the intrinsic properties defining the upper bound of a model's ability to generate valid, high-difficulty questions. Then, we develop CoDiQ-Generator from Qwen3-8B, which improves the upper bound of difficult question generation, making it particularly well-suited for challenging question construction. Building on the CoDiQ framework, we build CoDiQ-Corpus (44K competition-grade question sequences). Human evaluations show these questions are significantly more challenging than LiveCodeBench/AIME with over 82% solvability. Training LRMs on CoDiQ-Corpus substantially improves reasoning performance, verifying that scaling controlled-difficulty training questions enhances reasoning capabilities. We open-source CoDiQ-Corpus, CoDiQ-Generator, and implementations to support related research.",

However, running world models rely on hevay computational cost and memory footprint, making model quantization essential for efficient deployment. To date, the effects of post-training quantization (PTQ) on world models remain largely unexamined. In this work, we present a systematic empirical study of world model quantization using DINO-WM as a representative case, evaluating diverse PTQ methods under both weight-only and joint weight-activation settings. We conduct extensive experiments on different visual planning tasks across a wide range of bit-widths, quantization granularities, and planning horizons up to 50 iterations. Our results show that quantization effects in world models extend beyond standard accuracy and bit-width trade-offs: group-wise weight quantization can stabilize low-bit rollouts, activation quantization granularity yields inconsistent benefits, and quantization sensitivity is highly asymmetric between encoder and predictor modules. Moreover, aggressive low-bit quantization significantly degrades the alignment between the planning objective and task success, leading to failures that cannot be remedied by additional optimization. These findings reveal distinct quantization-induced failure modes in world model-based planning and provide practical guidance for deploying quantized world models under strict computational constraints.

      "abstract": "This paper introduces Deep Data Research , shifting from executional intelligence , which focuses on completing assigned tasks, to investigatory intelligence , where agents autonomously set goals and explore. Under this paradigm, Agentic LLMs are allowed to explore databases freely, discovering insights behind the data, without any predefined queries, questions, or objectives. The LLM-generated insights are evaluated against a fact checklist derived from the freeform components of the database, which naturally yields an aligned and objective evaluation. Beyond presenting DDR-Bench, the paper's experimental analysis reveals some insights into investigatory intelligence: Inference-time Scaling Dynamics : Top models exhibit \"quality over quantity\". They delay commitment and concentrate reasoning into a few high-value late-stage interactions. Token scaling shows flat-then-sharp patterns where final-stage tokens deliver disproportionate value, signalling depth-first exploration after breadth-oriented search. Balanced Exploration Regime : Entropy-based visualisation reveals advanced models consistently operate in a balanced regime combining coverage with focus, supporting an \"implicit planning hypothesis\" where strong models maintain coherent exploration strategies without explicit scaffolding. Training Trumps Scaling : Analysis of the Qwen family shows parameter scaling alone yields marginal gains (under 3% from 10× parameters), and longer context windows don't consistently help. However, cross-generation models with agentic-first training, including targeted pre-training and reinforcement learning, achieve substantially higher ceilings despite fewer activated parameters, demonstrating that meaningful agency requires intentional training strategies over mere scale. Scaffolding Paradox : Adding sophisticated frameworks like reasoning or memory mechanisms leads to unpredictable behaviours and may degrade performance. Proactive versus reactive comparison shows substantial gaps, confirming that autonomous goal-setting demands far exceed executing predefined objectives. Failure Modes : 58% of errors stem from insufficient exploration breadth/depth, while 40% involve other issues: powerful models over-reason with unsupported assumptions, weaker models struggle with instruction-following.",

One major reason is the cross-image information leakage, where the model struggles to distinguish information across different images. Existing LVLMs already employ delimiter tokens to mark the start and end of each image, yet our analysis reveals that these tokens fail to effectively block cross-image information leakage. To enhance their effectiveness, we propose a method that scales the hidden states of delimiter tokens. This enhances the model's ability to preserve image-specific information by reinforcing intra-image interaction and limiting undesired cross-image interactions. Consequently, the model is better able to distinguish between images and reason over them more accurately. Experiments show performance gains on multi-image benchmarks such as Mantis, MuirBench, MIRB, and QBench2. We further evaluate our method on text-only tasks that require clear distinction. The method improves performance on multi-document and multi-table understanding benchmarks, including TQABench, MultiNews, and WCEP-10.

To address this, we propose Prism (Pruning, Remasking, and Integrated Self-verification Method), an efficient TTS framework for dLLMs that (i) performs Hierarchical Trajectory Search (HTS) which dynamically prunes and reallocates compute in an early-to-mid denoising window, (ii) introduces Local branching with partial remasking to explore diverse implementations while preserving high-confidence tokens, and (iii) replaces external verifiers with Self-Verified Feedback (SVF) obtained via self-evaluation prompts on intermediate completions. Across four mathematical reasoning and code generation benchmarks on three dLLMs, including LLaDA 8B Instruct, Dream 7B Instruct, and LLaDA 2.0-mini, our Prism achieves a favorable performance-efficiency trade-off, matching best-of-N performance with substantially fewer function evaluations (NFE).

      "abstract": "Cross-lingual evaluation of large language models (LLMs) typically conflates two sources of variance: genuine model performance differences and measurement instability. We investigate evaluation reliability by holding generation conditions constant while varying target language. Using synthetic customer-support dialogues generated with identical parameters across Estonian, Finnish, and Hungarian, we test whether automatic metrics and LLM-as-a-judge scoring produce stable model rankings across these morphologically rich, related Finno-Ugric languages. With a small set of Estonian native speaker annotations as a reference point, we find systematic ranking instabilities: surface-level metrics (lexical diversity, surface and semantic similarity) maintain cross-language stability, but pragmatic judgments (coherence, instruction-following) exhibit rank inversions and near-zero correlations. Because generation is controlled, these inconsistencies reflect how judge scoring behaves differently across languages rather than true model differences. This controlled design provides a diagnostic probe: evaluation methods that fail to maintain stability under identical generation conditions signal transfer failure before deployment. Our findings suggest that zero-shot judge transfer is unreliable for discourse-level assessment in morphologically rich languages, motivating language-specific calibration against targeted human baselines. We release our controlled generation protocol, synthetic data, and evaluation framework to enable replication across language families at https://github.com/isaac-chung/ cross-lingual-stability-judges.",

This work introduces an automated data pipeline that mines high-purity single-event segments from unconstrained recordings and synthesizes mixtures using semantically consistent strategies, effectively reducing co-occurrence noise at the source. Based on this pipeline, the authors release Hive, a 2,000-hour high-quality synthetic dataset for data-efficient training. Despite using only ~0.2% of the data scale of million-hour baselines, models trained on Hive achieve competitive separation accuracy and perceptual quality, and show strong zero-shot generalization on out-of-distribution benchmarks such as MUSDB18-HQ and USS-Bench. The key takeaway is clear: prioritizing supervision purity can dramatically improve data efficiency, offering a practical path toward robust auditory foundation models with reduced compute and annotation costs.",

      "abstract": "Knowledge distillation offers a promising path to transfer reasoning capabilities from large teacher models to efficient student models; however, existing token-level on-policy distillation methods require token-level alignment between the student and teacher models, which restricts the student model’s exploration ability, prevent effective use of interactive environment feedback, and suffer from severe memory bottlenecks in reinforcement learning. We introduce On-policy Verbal Distillation (OVD), a memory-efficient framework that replaces token-level probability matching with trajectory matching using discrete verbal scores (0–9) from teacher models. OVD dramatically reduces memory consumption while enabling on-policy distillation from teacher models with verbal feedback, and avoids token-level alignment, allowing the student model to freely explore the output space. Extensive experiments on Web question answering and mathematical reasoning tasks show that OVD substantially outperforms existing methods, delivering up to +12.9% absolute improvement in average EM on Web Q&A tasks and a up to +25.7% gain on math benchmarks (when trained with only one random samples), while also exhibiting superior training efficiency.

      "abstract": "AI Ethics is framed distinctly across actors and stakeholder groups. We report results from a case study of OpenAI analysing ethical AI discourse. Research addressed: How has OpenAI's public discourse leveraged 'ethics', 'safety', 'alignment', and adjacent related concepts over time, and what does discourse signal about framing in practice? A structured corpus, differentiating between communication for a general audience and communication with an academic audience, was assembled from public documentation. Qualitative content analysis of ethical themes combined inductively derived and deductively applied codes. Quantitative analysis leveraged computational content analysis methods via NLP to model topics and quantify changes in rhetoric over time. Visualizations report aggregate results. Results indicate that safety and risk discourse dominate OpenAI's public communication and documentation, without applying academic and advocacy ethics frameworks or vocabularies. Implications for governance are presented, along with a discussion of ethics-washing practices in industry.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents YOLOE-26, a unified framework that integrates the deployment-optimized YOLO26(or YOLOv26) architecture with the open-vocabulary learning paradigm of YOLOE for real-time open-vocabulary instance segmentation. Building on the NMS-free, end-to-end design of YOLOv26, the proposed approach preserves the hallmark efficiency and determinism of the YOLO family while extending its capabilities beyond closed-set recognition. YOLOE-26 employs a convolutional backbone with PAN/FPN-style multi-scale feature aggregation, followed by end-to-end regression and instance segmentation heads. A key architecturAl contribution is the replacement of fixed class logits with an object embedding head, which formulates classification as similarity matching against prompt embeddings derived from text descriptions, visual examples, or a built-in vocabulary. To enable efficient open-vocabulary reasoning, the framework incorporates Re-Parameterizable Region-Text Alignment (RepRTA) for zero-overhead text prompting, a Semantic-Activated Visual Prompt Encoder (SAVPE) for example-guided segmentation, and Lazy Region Prompt Contrast for prompt-free inference. All prompting modalities operate within a unified object embedding space, allowing seamless switching between text-prompted, visual-prompted, and fully autonomous segmentation. Extensive experiments demonstrate consistent scaling behavior and favorable accuracy-efficiency trade-offs across model sizes in both prompted and prompt-free settings. The training strategy leverages large-scale detection and grounding datasets with multi-task optimization and remains fully compatible with the Ultralytics ecosystem for training, validation, and deployment. Overall, YOLOE-26 provides a practical and scalable solution for real-time open-vocabulary instance segmentation in dynamic, real-world environments.",

      "abstract": "TL;DR: The assumption that an agent's Chain-of-Thought (CoT) faithfully reflects its internal reasoning and environment state is brittle, which can reflect badly on the reliability of LLM judges that use the agent reasoning for evaluation. Our key finding is that simply rewriting agent CoTs while keeping actions and observations fixed, the false positive rates of state-of-the-art VLM judges can be inflated by up to 90%.  Specialized prompting and scaling judge-time compute can reduce susceptibility; they do not fully eliminate the vulnerability to manipulation. 📝  Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14691 Code and trajectories will be released soon.",
