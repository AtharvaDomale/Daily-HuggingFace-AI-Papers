      "abstract": "🔆 Overview We argue that presentation design is inherently subjective. Users have different preferences in terms of narrative structure, emphasis, conciseness, aesthetic choices, etc. So in this work, we ask: Can we better model such diverse user preferences for personalized paper-to-slides generation? We make the following contributions: Task: We introduce and properly define a new task that conditions paper-to-slide generation on user-specified preferences. System: We propose a human behavior-inspired agentic framework, SlideTailor, that progressively generates editable slides in a user-aligned manner. Evaluation: We construct a benchmark dataset that captures diverse user preferences, with meticulously designed interpretable metrics for robust evaluation. Open Source: We release the source code and data to the community. 💻 Github: https://github.com/nusnlp/SlideTailor 📜 ArXiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20292 🤗 HF datasets: https://huggingface.co/datasets/yyyang/SlideTailor-PSP-dataset",

      "abstract": "Large reasoning models (LRMs) are typically trained using reinforcement learning with verifiable reward (RLVR) to enhance their reasoning abilities. In this paradigm, policies are updated using both positive and negative self-generated rollouts, which correspond to distinct sample polarities. In this paper, we provide a systematic investigation into how these sample polarities affect RLVR training dynamics and behaviors. We find that positive samples sharpen existing correct reasoning patterns, while negative samples encourage exploration of new reasoning paths. We further explore how adjusting the advantage values of positive and negative samples at both the sample level and the token level affects RLVR training. Based on these insights, we propose an Adaptive and Asymmetric token-level Advantage shaping method for Policy Optimization, namely A3PO, that more precisely allocates advantage signals to key tokens across different polarities. Experiments across five reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.",
