      "abstract": "Adapting LLM agents to domain-specific tool calling remains notably brittle under evolving interfaces. Prompt and schema engineering is easy to deploy but often fragile under distribution shift and strict parsers, while continual parameter-efficient fine-tuning improves reliability at the cost of training, maintenance, and potential forgetting. We identify a critical Lazy Agent failure mode where tool necessity is nearly perfectly decodable from mid-layer activations, yet the model remains conservative in entering tool mode, revealing a representation-behavior gap. We propose Activation Steering Adapter (ASA), a training-free, inference-time controller that performs a single-shot mid-layer intervention and targets tool domains via a router-conditioned mixture of steering vectors with a probe-guided signed gate to amplify true intent while suppressing spurious triggers. On MTU-Bench with Qwen2.5-1.5B, ASA improves strict tool-use F1 from 0.18 to 0.50 while reducing the false positive rate from 0.15 to 0.05, using only about 20KB of portable assets and no weight updates.",

These meta-experiences are then distilled into the model's parametric memory via NLL minimization, inducing a language-modeled reward signal that bridges correct and incorrect reasoning paths and enables effective knowledge reuse.",

      "abstract": "Omni-modal large language models (OLLMs) aim to unify multimodal understanding and generation, yet incorporating speech with 3D facial animation remains largely unexplored despite its importance for natural interaction. A key challenge arises from the representation mismatch between discrete, token-level semantic reasoning in LLMs and the dense, fine-grained temporal dynamics required for 3D facial motion, which makes direct modeling difficult to optimize under limited data. We propose Expressive Omni (Ex-Omni), an open-source omni-modal framework that augments OLLMs with speech-accompanied 3D facial animation. Ex-Omni reduces learning difficulty by decoupling semantic reasoning from temporal generation, leveraging speech units as temporal scaffolding and a unified token-as-query gated fusion (TQGF) mechanism for controlled semantic injection. We further introduce InstructEx, a dataset aims to facilitate augment OLLMs with speech-accompanied 3D facial animation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Ex-Omni performs competitively against existing open-source OLLMs while enabling stable aligned speech and facial animation generation.",

We introduce EcoGym, a generalizable benchmark for continuous plan-and-execute decision making in interactive economies. EcoGym comprises three diverse environments: Vending, Freelance, and Operation, implemented in a unified decision-making process with standardized interfaces, and budgeted actions over an effectively unbounded horizon (1000+ steps if 365 day-loops for evaluation). The evaluation of EcoGym is based on business-relevant outcomes (e.g., net worth, income, and DAU), targeting long-term strategic coherence and robustness under partial observability and stochasticity. Experiments across eleven leading LLMs expose a systematic tension: no single model dominates across all three scenarios. Critically, we find that models exhibit significant suboptimality in either high-level strategies or efficient actions executions. EcoGym is released as an open, extensible testbed for transparent long-horizon agent evaluation and for studying controllability-utility trade-offs in realistic economic settings.",

      "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently strengthened LLM reasoning, but its focus on final answer correctness leaves a critical gap: it does not ensure the robustness of the reasoning process itself. We adopt a simple philosophical view, robust reasoning should remain useful beyond the mind that produced it, and treat reasoning as a form of meaning transfer that must survive truncation, reinterpretation, and continuation. Building on this principle, we introduce Reinforcement Learning with Transferable Reward (RLTR), which operationalizes robustness via transfer reward that tests whether a partial reasoning prefix from one model can guide a separate model to the correct answer. This encourages LLMs to produce reasoning that is stable, interpretable, and genuinely generalizable. Our approach improves sampling consistency while improving final answer accuracy, and it reaches comparable performance in substantially fewer training steps. For example, on MATH500, RLTR achieves a +3.6%p gain in Maj@64 compared to RLVR and matches RLVR's average accuracy with roughly 2.5x fewer training steps, providing both more reliable reasoning and significantly more sample efficient.",

      "abstract": "The Magic of Forgetting! Reasoning models enhance problem-solving by scaling test-time compute, yet they face a critical paradox: excessive thinking tokens often degrade performance rather than improve it. We attribute this to a fundamental architectural flaw: standard LLMs operate as \"malloc-only\" engines, continuously accumulating valid and redundant steps alike without a mechanism to prune obsolete information. To break this cycle, we propose Free()LM, a model that introduces an intrinsic self-forgetting capability via the Free-Module, a plug-and-play LoRA adapter. By iteratively switching between reasoning and cleaning modes, Free()LM dynamically identifies and prunes useless context chunks, maintaining a compact and noise-free state. Extensive experiments show that Free()LM provides consistent improvements across all model scales (8B to 685B). It achieves a 3.3% average improvement over top-tier reasoning baselines, even establishing a new SOTA on IMOanswerBench using DeepSeek V3.2-Speciale. Most notably, in long-horizon tasks where the standard Qwen3-235B-A22B model suffers a total collapse (0% accuracy), Free()LM restores performance to 50%. Our findings suggest that sustainable intelligence requires the freedom to forget as much as the power to think.",

      "abstract": "Reasoning Cache: Continual Improvement Over Long Horizons via Short-Horizon RL Large Language Models (LLMs) that can continually improve beyond their training budgets are able to solve increasingly difficult problems by adapting at test time, a property we refer to as extrapolation. However, standard reinforcement learning (RL) operates over fixed problem distributions and training budgets, which limits extrapolation amidst distribution shift at test time. To address this, we introduce RC, an iterative decoding algorithm that replaces standard autoregressive decoding during both training and inference. RC exploits an asymmetry between the response generation and summarization capabilities of LLMs to construct reasoning chains that consistently improve across iterations. Models trained to use RC can extrapolate and continually improve over reasoning horizons more than an order of magnitude longer than those seen during training. Empirically, training a 4B model with RC using a 16k-token training budget improves performance on HMMT 2025 from 40% to nearly 70% with 0.5m tokens at test time, outperforming both comparably sized models and many larger reasoning LLMs. Finally, we also show that models trained with RC can more effectively leverage existing scaffolds to further scale test-time performance, due to the improved summary-conditioned generation abilities learned through training.",

Based on the observation that teacher trajectories exhibit inherently non-linear dynamics, ArcFlow introduces a momentum-based velocity parameterization with an analytic solver to enable more faithful alignment under very few NFEs. Across Qwen-Image-20B and FLUX.1-dev, we find that this formulation results in stable 2-step generation with lightweight LoRA tuning, while maintaining strong alignment with the teacher distribution. We hope this perspective may provide a useful direction for improving efficiency without sacrificing trajectory fidelity.",

      "title": "UMEM: Unified Memory Extraction and Management Framework for Generalizable Memory",
      "abstract": "UMEM: Unified Memory Extraction and Management Framework for Generalizable Memory This paper presents a systematic solution to a core bottleneck in self-evolving agents, offering the following notable contributions: Core Problem Insight The authors accurately identify a fundamental limitation in existing approaches: the decoupled treatment of memory extraction and memory management . Current state-of-the-art methods (e.g., ReMem, Memp) focus solely on optimizing management strategies while treating extraction as a static prompting process. This design leads to two critical pitfalls: Instance-level noise accumulation : Blindly memorizing concrete details rather than generalizable principles results in a \"rote memorization\" trap. Strategy misalignment : Low-quality extracted memories render even optimal management strategies ineffective, creating a \"garbage in, garbage out\" vicious cycle. Methodological Innovations UMEM's key innovation lies in the end-to-end joint optimization of extraction and management , with three pivotal designs ensuring generalizability: Semantic Neighborhood Modeling : Queries are clustered based on cosine similarity, transforming cross-task generalization into an intra-neighborhood consistency optimization problem. Theoretical guarantees for retrieval stability are provided via formal lemmas. Marginal Utility Reward : Memory value is evaluated at the neighborhood level through a novel reward combining success gain and efficiency regularization, compelling the agent to discard instance-specific noise. Online Memory Evolution : The memory bank is dynamically updated during training, enabling co-evolution of policy learning and memory states, thereby overcoming limitations imposed by static memory assumptions. Comprehensive Experimental Validation UMEM achieves significant performance gains over baselines across five heterogeneous benchmarks (AIME, GPQA, ALFWorld, etc.), with improvements up to 10.67% on multi-turn interactive tasks. Ablation studies compellingly demonstrate that optimizing extraction alone is more critical than optimizing management alone (performance drop of 4.70 points vs. 0.73 points), challenging the prevailing \"management-first\" paradigm. Continual evolution experiments reveal that UMEM exhibits a monotonically improving trajectory , whereas baselines such as ReMem rapidly degrade due to noise accumulation—validating the long-term value of the generalization-oriented design. Cross-model transfer experiments (Qwen3 → GPT-5.1 → Gemini) confirm that extracted memories possess architecture-agnostic utility. Broader Impact and Implications This work redefines the optimization paradigm for self-evolving agents: memory quality hinges on the synergy between extraction and management, rather than maximal optimization of either component in isolation . The \"neighborhood generalization\" principle offers valuable insights for continual learning and experience transfer. Notably, the paper draws an analogy between agent evolution and neural network training (forward inference + backward optimization), providing a fresh perspective on understanding learning mechanisms in LLM-based agents. Directions for Further Discussion The reliance on pretrained encoders for semantic neighborhood construction warrants deeper investigation into generalization boundaries under out-of-distribution tasks. Trade-offs between computational overhead (evaluating N neighborhood queries) and real-time deployment requirements merit further exploration. Potential complementarity with parameter-based continual learning approaches remains an open avenue for integration. In summary, through rigorous problem deconstruction and an innovative joint optimization framework, UMEM establishes a vital pathway toward building truly sustainable self-evolving agents. It represents a substantive and well-grounded contribution to the field of memory-augmented agent research.",

Vision-language-action (VLA) models offer a promising framework, but they assume temporally aligned reasoning and control, despite semantic inference being inherently delayed relative to real-time action. We introduce Think-in-Control (TIC)-VLA, a latency-aware framework that explicitly models delayed semantic reasoning during action generation. TIC-VLA defines a delayed semantic-control interface that conditions action generation on delayed vision-language semantic states and explicit latency metadata, in addition to current observations, enabling policies to compensate for asynchronous reasoning. We further propose a latency-consistent training pipeline that injects reasoning inference delays during imitation learning and online reinforcement learning, aligning training with asynchronous deployment. To support realistic evaluation, we present DynaNav, a physics-accurate, photo-realistic simulation suite for language-guided navigation in dynamic environments. Extensive experiments in simulation and on a real robot show that TIC-VLA consistently outperforms prior VLA models while maintaining robust real-time control under multi-second reasoning latency.",

      "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for code generation in fast, informal development workflows, often referred to as vibe coding, where speed and convenience are prioritized, and security requirements are rarely made explicit. In this setting, models frequently produce functionally correct but insecure code, creating a growing security risk. Existing approaches to improving code security rely on full-parameter fine-tuning or parameter-efficient adaptations, which are either costly and prone to catastrophic forgetting or operate at coarse granularity with limited interpretability and control. We present GoodVibe, a neuron-level framework for improving the security of code language models by default. GoodVibe is based on the key insight that security-relevant reasoning is localized to a small subset of neurons. We identify these neurons using gradient-based attribution from a supervised security task and perform neuron-selective fine-tuning that updates only this security-critical subspace. To further reduce training cost, we introduce activation-driven neuron clustering, enabling structured updates with minimal overhead. We evaluate GoodVibe on six LLMs across security-critical programming languages, including C++, Java, Swift, and Go. GoodVibe substantially improves the security of generated code while preserving general model utility, achieving up to a 2.5x improvement over base models, matching or exceeding full fine-tuning with over 4,700x fewer trainable parameters, and reducing training computation by more than 3.6x compared to the parameter-efficient baseline (LoRA). Our results demonstrate that neuron-level optimization offers an effective and scalable approach to securing code generation without sacrificing efficiency or generality.",

      "abstract": "The rapid adoption of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures marks a major shift in the deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs). MoE LLMs improve scaling efficiency by activating only a small subset of parameters per token, but their routing structure introduces new safety attack surfaces. We find that safety-critical behaviors in MoE LLMs (e.g., refusal) are concentrated in a small set of experts rather than being uniformly distributed. Building on this, we propose Large Language Lobotomy (L), a training-free, architecture-agnostic attack that compromises safety alignment by exploiting expert routing dynamics. L learns routing patterns that correlate with refusal, attributes safety behavior to specific experts, and adaptively silences the most safety-relevant experts until harmful outputs are produced. We evaluate L on eight state-of-the-art open-source MoE LLMs and show that our adaptive expert silencing increases average attack success from 7.3% to 70.4%, reaching up to 86.3%, outperforming prior training-free MoE jailbreak methods. Moreover, bypassing guardrails typically requires silencing fewer than 20% of layer-wise experts while largely preserving general language utility. These results reveal a fundamental tension between efficiency-driven MoE design and robust safety alignment and motivate distributing safety mechanisms more robustly in future MoE LLMs with architecture- and routing-aware methods.",
