      "title": "The Devil Behind Moltbook: Anthropic Safety is Always Vanishing in Self-Evolving AI Societies",
      "abstract": "The emergence of multi-agent systems built from large language models (LLMs) offers a promising paradigm for scalable collective intelligence and self-evolution. Ideally, such systems would achieve continuous self-improvement in a fully closed loop while maintaining robust safety alignment--a combination we term the self-evolution trilemma. However, we demonstrate both theoretically and empirically that an agent society satisfying continuous self-evolution, complete isolation, and safety invariance is impossible. Drawing on an information-theoretic framework, we formalize safety as the divergence degree from anthropic value distributions. We theoretically demonstrate that isolated self-evolution induces statistical blind spots, leading to the irreversible degradation of the system's safety alignment. Empirical and qualitative results from an open-ended agent community (Moltbook) and two closed self-evolving systems reveal phenomena that align with our theoretical prediction of inevitable safety erosion. We further propose several solution directions to alleviate the identified safety concern. Our work establishes a fundamental limit on the self-evolving AI societies and shifts the discourse from symptom-driven safety patches to a principled understanding of intrinsic dynamical risks, highlighting the need for external oversight or novel safety-preserving mechanisms.",

      "abstract": "Legal reasoning requires not only correct outcomes but also procedurally compliant reasoning processes. However, existing methods lack mechanisms to verify intermediate reasoning steps, allowing errors such as inapplicable statute citations to propagate undetected through the reasoning chain. To address this, we propose LawThinker, an autonomous legal research agent that adopts an Explore-Verify-Memorize strategy for dynamic judicial environments. The core idea is to enforce verification as an atomic operation after every knowledge exploration step. A DeepVerifier module examines each retrieval result along three dimensions of knowledge accuracy, fact-law relevance, and procedural compliance, with a memory module for cross-round knowledge reuse in long-horizon tasks. Experiments on the dynamic benchmark J1-EVAL show that LawThinker achieves a 24% improvement over direct reasoning and an 11% gain over workflow-based methods, with particularly strong improvements on process-oriented metrics. Evaluations on three static benchmarks further confirm its generalization capability.",

      "abstract": "The core idea of Thinking with Drafting (TwD) is super refreshing: instead of letting a multimodal model “guess the answer” with fluent CoT or pretty-looking diagrams, it forces the model to draft its reasoning into executable structure. Not vibes. Not plausible pixels. But strict, renderable DSL code. The “optical decompression” framing is also 🔥 — OCR gives you symbols, but not logical topology. TwD says: real understanding = reconstructing the hidden structure behind those symbols. And the moment the model has to commit to aligned segments, brackets, and cross-row constraints, hallucination becomes much harder. What I like most is the shift from: generate explanation → hope it’s right to generate structure → verify it deterministically That feels like a big step toward trustworthy multimodal reasoning.",

      "title": "Stroke of Surprise: Progressive Semantic Illusions in Vector Sketching",
      "abstract": "Visual illusions traditionally rely on spatial manipulations such as multi-view consistency. In this work, we introduce Progressive Semantic Illusions, a novel vector sketching task where a single sketch undergoes a dramatic semantic transformation through the sequential addition of strokes. We present Stroke of Surprise, a generative framework that optimizes vector strokes to satisfy distinct semantic interpretations at different drawing stages. The core challenge lies in the \"dual-constraint\": initial prefix strokes must form a coherent object (e.g., a duck) while simultaneously serving as the structural foundation for a second concept (e.g., a sheep) upon adding delta strokes. To address this, we propose a sequence-aware joint optimization framework driven by a dual-branch Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) mechanism. Unlike sequential approaches that freeze the initial state, our method dynamically adjusts prefix strokes to discover a \"common structural subspace\" valid for both targets. Furthermore, we introduce a novel Overlay Loss that enforces spatial complementarity, ensuring structural integration rather than occlusion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in recognizability and illusion strength, successfully expanding visual anagrams from the spatial to the temporal dimension.",

However, in practice, their inference efficiency is constrained by the need for many refinement steps, while aggressively reducing the number of steps leads to a substantial degradation in generation quality. To alleviate this, we propose a trajectory self-distillation framework that improves few-step decoding by distilling the model's own generative trajectories. We incorporate Direct Discriminative Optimization (DDO), a reverse-KL objective that promotes mode-seeking distillation and encourages the student to concentrate on high-probability teacher modes. Across benchmarks, our approach consistently outperforms strong few-step baselines and standard training under tight step budgets. Although full-step decoding remains superior, we substantially narrow the gap, establishing a strong foundation towards practical few-step DLLMs.",

      "abstract": "Metaphorical comprehension in images remains a critical challenge for Nowadays AI systems. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at basic Visual Question Answering (VQA), they consistently struggle to grasp the nuanced cultural, emotional, and contextual implications embedded in visual content. This difficulty stems from the task's demand for sophisticated multi-hop reasoning, cultural context, and Theory of Mind (ToM) capabilities, which current models lack. To fill this gap, we propose MetaphorStar, the first end-to-end visual reinforcement learning (RL) framework for image implication tasks. Our framework includes three core components: the fine-grained dataset TFQ-Data, the visual RL method TFQ-GRPO, and the well-structured benchmark TFQ-Bench. Our fully open-source MetaphorStar family, trained using TFQ-GRPO on TFQ-Data, significantly improves performance by an average of 82.6% on the image implication benchmarks. Compared with 20+ mainstream MLLMs, MetaphorStar-32B achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) on Multiple-Choice Question and Open-Style Question, significantly outperforms the top closed-source model Gemini-3.0-pro on True-False Question. Crucially, our experiments reveal that learning image implication tasks improves the general understanding ability, especially the complex visual reasoning ability. We further provide a systematic analysis of model parameter scaling, training data scaling, and the impact of different model architectures and training strategies, demonstrating the broad applicability of our method. We open-sourced all model weights, datasets, and method code.",

This setting is common in 🔬 scientific reasoning and 📐 mathematical proofs, where correct solutions are often non unique and expressed as structured natural language rather than fixed outputs. Traditional reward signals simply do not work in these scenarios. To address this, we propose a ✨ geometric consensus reward that models agreement, reliability, and diversity, enabling RL training without ground truth final answers.

      "title": "P-GenRM: Personalized Generative Reward Model with Test-time User-based Scaling",
      "abstract": "Personalized alignment of large language models seeks to adapt responses to individual user preferences, typically via reinforcement learning. A key challenge is obtaining accurate, user-specific reward signals in open-ended scenarios. Existing personalized reward models face two persistent limitations: (1) oversimplifying diverse, scenario-specific preferences into a small, fixed set of evaluation principles, and (2) struggling with generalization to new users with limited feedback. To this end, we propose P-GenRM, the first Personalized Generative Reward Model with test-time user-based scaling. P-GenRM transforms preference signals into structured evaluation chains that derive adaptive personas and scoring rubrics across various scenarios. It further clusters users into User Prototypes and introduces a dual-granularity scaling mechanism: at the individual level, it adaptively scales and aggregates each user's scoring scheme; at the prototype level, it incorporates preferences from similar users. This design mitigates noise in inferred preferences and enhances generalization to unseen users through prototype-based transfer. Empirical results show that P-GenRM achieves state-of-the-art results on widely-used personalized reward model benchmarks, with an average improvement of 2.31%, and demonstrates strong generalization on an out-of-distribution dataset. Notably, Test-time User-based scaling provides an additional 3% boost, demonstrating stronger personalized alignment with test-time scalability.",

      "abstract": "Don't Let Your Agent Max Out Your Credit Card! 💳 Most current research pushes the boundaries of agent performance but often overlooks the actual economic cost. Can agents still make rational decisions when every tool call comes with a price tag? We introduce INTENT, a lightweight inference-time framework that predicts future spending through \"intention-level\" simulations. It allows agents to remain highly efficient even under strict budget constraints—without the need for retraining or exhaustive searches. This is more than just a technical improvement; it's our initial exploration into the burgeoning field of Agent Economics .",

      "abstract": "ScalSelect: Training-Free and Scalable Data Selection for Visual Instruction Tuning Large-scale visual instruction tuning datasets are highly redundant, yet full-data training remains the default — leading to substantial computational waste. This paper introduces ScalSelect, a training-free and gradient-free data selection method with linear-time complexity, specifically designed for visual instruction tuning. 💡 Key Ideas Leverages instruction-conditioned attention representations to better capture instruction-relevant visual signals Selects samples from a dominant global subspace, rather than relying on pairwise similarity or proxy model training Scalable — no additional models, no additional datasets, training-free, no gradient training, linear-time complexity with respect to data size,  required for selection 📊 Results Using only 16% of the data, ScalSelect retains ≥97.5% of full-data performance, and in some cases even surpasses training on the entire dataset. 🚀 Why It Matters ScalSelect provides a practical and scalable solution for multimodal training. As VLMs continue to scale, data curation becomes increasingly critical — and this work offers a simple yet principled direction forward. Code: https://github.com/ChangtiWu/ScalSelect",

      "title": "Detecting RLVR Training Data via Structural Convergence of Reasoning",
      "abstract": "Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) is central to training modern reasoning models, but the undisclosed training data raises concerns about benchmark contamination. Unlike pretraining methods, which optimize models using token-level probabilities, RLVR fine-tunes models based on reward feedback from self-generated reasoning trajectories, making conventional likelihood-based detection methods less effective. We show that RLVR induces a distinctive behavioral signature: prompts encountered during RLVR training result in more rigid and similar generations, while unseen prompts retain greater diversity. We introduce Min-kNN Distance, a simple black-box detector that quantifies this collapse by sampling multiple completions for a given prompt and computing the average of the k smallest nearest-neighbor edit distances. Min-kNN Distance requires no access to the reference model or token probabilities. Experiments across multiple RLVR-trained reasoning models show that Min-kNN Distance reliably distinguishes RL-seen examples from unseen ones and outperforms existing membership inference and RL contamination detection baselines.",
