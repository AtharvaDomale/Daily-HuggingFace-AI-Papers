      "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce VERGE, a neuro-symbolic framework designed to bridge the semantic gap between LLM fluency and formal correctness by addressing the \"all-or-nothing\" limitation of traditional solvers. A key innovation is Semantic Routing, which dynamically classifies atomic claims to handle non-formalizable natural language; verifiable logic is sent to SMT solvers (Z3) for proof, while ambiguous or commonsense claims are routed to a consensus-based \"soft verifier,\" preventing the system from breaking on vague predicates. Furthermore, we replace generic error signals with actionable feedback via Minimal Correction Subsets (MCS), which pinpoint the precise subset of conflicting claims to revise, enabling the model to iteratively refine its reasoning from \"probabilistic\" to \"provable\" with an 18.7% performance uplift",

      "abstract": "Despite decades of research on reverberant speech, comparing methods remains difficult because most corpora lack per-file acoustic annotations or provide limited documentation for reproduction. We present RIR-Mega-Speech, a corpus of approximately 117.5 hours created by convolving LibriSpeech utterances with roughly 5,000 simulated room impulse responses from the RIR-Mega collection. Every file includes RT60, direct-to-reverberant ratio (DRR), and clarity index (C_{50}) computed from the source RIR using clearly defined, reproducible procedures. We also provide scripts to rebuild the dataset and reproduce all evaluation results. Using Whisper small on 1,500 paired utterances, we measure 5.20% WER (95% CI: 4.69--5.78) on clean speech and 7.70% (7.04--8.35) on reverberant versions, corresponding to a paired increase of 2.50 percentage points (2.06--2.98). This represents a 48% relative degradation. WER increases monotonically with RT60 and decreases with DRR, consistent with prior perceptual studies. While the core finding that reverberation harms recognition is well established, we aim to provide the community with a standardized resource where acoustic conditions are transparent and results can be verified independently. The repository includes one-command rebuild instructions for both Windows and Linux environments.",
