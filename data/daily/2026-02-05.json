Instead of relying on static roles or isolated context threads, AORCHESTRA enables dynamic, on-demand creation of specialized sub-agents with explicit context control and cost awareness. This abstraction decouples orchestration from execution, making the system plug-and-play across heterogeneous agent backends.

      "title": "daVinci-Agency: Unlocking Long-Horizon Agency Data-Efficiently",
      "abstract": "While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at short-term tasks, scaling them to long-horizon agentic workflows remains challenging. The core bottleneck lies in the scarcity of training data that captures authentic long-dependency structures and cross-stage evolutionary dynamics—existing synthesis methods either confine to single-feature scenarios constrained by model distribution, or incur prohibitive human annotation costs, failing to provide scalable, high-quality supervision. We address this by reconceptualizing data synthesis through the lens of real-world software evolution. Our key insight: Pull Request (PR) sequences naturally embody the supervision signals for long-horizon learning. They decompose complex objectives into verifiable submission units, maintain functional coherence across iterations, and encode authentic refinement patterns through bug-fix histories. Building on this, we propose daVinci-Agency , which systematically mines structured supervision from chain-of-PRs through three interlocking mechanisms: (1) progressive task decomposition via continuous commits, (2) long-term consistency enforcement through unified functional objectives, and (3) verifiable refinement from authentic bug-fix trajectories. Unlike synthetic trajectories that treat each step independently, daVinci-Agency's PR-grounded structure inherently preserves the causal dependencies and iterative refinements essential for teaching persistent goal-directed behavior and enables natural alignment with project-level, full-cycle task modeling. The resulting trajectories are substantial—averaging 85k tokens and 116 tool calls—yet remarkably data-efficient: fine-tuning GLM-4.6 on 239 daVinci-Agency samples yields broad improvements across benchmarks, notably achieving a 47% relative gain on Toolathlon. Beyond benchmark performance, our analysis confirms the model's effective internalization of long-horizon behaviors and unveils training and inference scaling laws specific to extended planning tasks. Our work establishes daVinci-Agency as a scalable paradigm that overcomes the limitations of single-feature synthesis, demonstrating that modeling real-world evolutionary trajectories offers a principled path to unlock the intrinsic long-horizon potential of agents.",

      "abstract": "Parallel thinking has emerged as a promising paradigm for reasoning, yet it imposes significant computational burdens. Existing efficiency methods primarily rely on local, per-trajectory signals and lack principled mechanisms to exploit global dynamics across parallel branches. We introduce 2D probing, an interface that exposes the width-depth dynamics of parallel thinking by periodically eliciting intermediate answers from all branches. Our analysis reveals three key insights: non-monotonic scaling across width-depth allocations, heterogeneous reasoning branch lengths, and early stabilization of global consensus. Guided by these insights, we introduce Parallel-Probe, a training-free controller designed to optimize online parallel thinking. Parallel-Probe employs consensus-based early stopping to regulate reasoning depth and deviation-based branch pruning to dynamically adjust width. Extensive experiments across three benchmarks and multiple models demonstrate that Parallel-Probe establishes a superior Pareto frontier for test-time scaling. Compared to standard majority voting, it reduces sequential tokens by up to 35.8% and total token cost by over 25.8% while maintaining competitive accuracy.",

      "abstract": "Nowadays, training and evaluating DeepResearch-generated reports remain challenging due to the lack of verifiable reward signals. Accordingly, rubric-based evaluation has become a common practice. However, existing approaches either rely on coarse, pre-defined rubrics that lack sufficient granularity, or depend on manually constructed query-specific rubrics that are costly and difficult to scale. In this paper, we propose a pipeline to train human-preference-aligned query-specific rubric generators tailored for DeepResearch report generation. We first construct a dataset of DeepResearch-style queries annotated with human preferences over paired reports, and train rubric generators via reinforcement learning with a hybrid reward combining human preference supervision and LLM-based rubric evaluation. To better handle long-horizon reasoning, we further introduce a Multi-agent Markov-state (MaMs) workflow for report generation. We empirically show that our proposed rubric generators deliver more discriminative and better human-aligned supervision than existing rubric design strategies. Moreover, when integrated into the MaMs training framework, DeepResearch systems equipped with our rubric generators consistently outperform all open-source baselines on the DeepResearch Bench and achieve performance comparable to that of leading closed-source models.",

      "abstract": "The Homotopy paradigm, a general principle for solving challenging problems, appears across diverse domains such as robust optimization, global optimization, polynomial root-finding, and sampling. Practical solvers for these problems typically follow a predictor-corrector (PC) structure, but rely on hand-crafted heuristics for step sizes and iteration termination, which are often suboptimal and task-specific. To address this, we unify these problems under a single framework, which enables the design of a general neural solver. Building on this unified view, we propose Neural Predictor-Corrector (NPC), which replaces hand-crafted heuristics with automatically learned policies. NPC formulates policy selection as a sequential decision-making problem and leverages reinforcement learning to automatically discover efficient strategies. To further enhance generalization, we introduce an amortized training mechanism, enabling one-time offline training for a class of problems and efficient online inference on new instances. Experiments on four representative homotopy problems demonstrate that our method generalizes effectively to unseen instances. It consistently outperforms classical and specialized baselines in efficiency while demonstrating superior stability across tasks, highlighting the value of unifying homotopy methods into a single neural framework.",

Second, we introduce WideSeek, a dynamic hierarchical multi-agent architecture that could autonomously fork parallel sub-agents based on task requirements.

Scaled to an 8B language model, XDLM attains 15.0 MBPP in 32 steps, nearly doubling baseline performance, with strong potential for long-term scaling.

      "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has shown strong promise for improving LLM reasoning, but in practice it often fails silently: for many hard prompts, all rollouts receive zero reward, causing training to stall or collapse. 🔍 Key observation Through token-level analysis, we find that many failed rollouts are not due to problem difficulty. Instead, failures are often caused by a very small number of “interference tokens” (<5%) that derail the entire reasoning trajectory. ✂️ Interference Token Purification Simply removing these high-interference tokens can: turn failed rollouts into successful ones improve rollout accuracy by 20%+ on previously zero-reward prompts 🚀 Method: Less Noise Sampling (LENS) We introduce LENS, an online selective rollout framework for RLVR: Identify & remove interference tokens in low-success prompts to unlock successful rollouts Transfer learning back to the original noisy prompts, using denoised rollouts as high-reward supervision → the model learns to ignore noise, not just solve cleaner prompts 📊 Results Pareto improvement over GRPO in performance–efficiency trade-offs +3.88% average accuracy gain across 7 math reasoning benchmarks 1.6× faster convergence with less compute Outperforms both rollout scaling and prompt filtering baselines 💡 Takeaway Low-success prompts are not useless—they contain valuable signals hidden behind a few noisy tokens. Pruning interference tokens offers a new perspective on improving exploration efficiency in RLVR. 🔗 Links Paper: Less Noise Sampling Framework for RLVR Keywords: RLVR, GRPO, reasoning, rollout efficiency, token-level analysis",

      "abstract": "Recently, there have been significant research interests in training large language models (LLMs) with reinforcement learning (RL) on real-world tasks, such as multi-turn code generation. While online RL tends to perform better than offline RL, its higher training cost and instability hinders wide adoption. In this paper, we build on the observation that multi-turn code generation can be formulated as a one-step recoverable Markov decision process and propose contextual bandit learning with offline trajectories (Cobalt), a new method that combines the benefits of online and offline RL. Cobalt first collects code generation trajectories using a reference LLM and divides them into partial trajectories as contextual prompts. Then, during online bandit learning, the LLM is trained to complete each partial trajectory prompt through single-step code generation. Cobalt outperforms two multi-turn online RL baselines based on GRPO and VeRPO, and substantially improves R1-Distill 8B and Qwen3 8B by up to 9.0 and 6.2 absolute Pass@1 scores on LiveCodeBench. Also, we analyze LLMs' in-context reward hacking behaviors and augment Cobalt training with perturbed trajectories to mitigate this issue. Overall, our results demonstrate Cobalt as a promising solution for iterative decision-making tasks like multi-turn code generation.

It converts recent, expert-validated scientific insights from top ML conferences into masked discovery challenges, forcing agents to rediscover human-verified insights rather than reproduce methods. By anchoring open-ended exploration to human-grounded ground truth and evaluating discovery at the claim level, FIRE-Bench reveals a clear “science gap”: today’s best agents are less capable (<50 F1), unreliable, and fail mainly at planning and reasoning, not coding. The benchmark offers a scalable, structured way to convert a paper into a constrained discovery problem to measure progress toward reliable, creative, full-cycle scientific discovery, and targets a path toward live, continuously updated evaluation of research-capable AI.",

      "abstract": "With the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), general-purpose agents have seen fundamental advancements. However, evaluating these agents presents unique challenges that distinguish them from static QA benchmarks. We observe that current agent benchmarks are heavily confounded by extraneous factors, including system prompts, toolset configurations, and environmental dynamics. Existing evaluations often rely on fragmented, researcher-specific frameworks where the prompt engineering for reasoning and tool usage varies significantly, making it difficult to attribute performance gains to the model itself. Additionally, the lack of standardized environmental data leads to untraceable errors and non-reproducible results. This lack of standardization introduces substantial unfairness and opacity into the field. We propose that a unified evaluation framework is essential for the rigorous advancement of agent evaluation. To this end, we introduce a proposal aimed at standardizing agent evaluation.",

      "title": "Didactic to Constructive: Turning Expert Solutions into Learnable Reasoning",
      "abstract": "Improving the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) typically relies either on the model's ability to sample a correct solution to be reinforced or on the existence of a stronger model able to solve the problem. However, many difficult problems remain intractable for even current frontier models, preventing the extraction of valid training signals. A promising alternative is to leverage high-quality expert human solutions, yet naive imitation of this data fails because it is fundamentally out of distribution: expert solutions are typically didactic, containing implicit reasoning gaps intended for human readers rather than computational models. Furthermore, high-quality expert solutions are expensive, necessitating generalizable sample-efficient training methods. We propose Distribution Aligned Imitation Learning (DAIL), a two-step method that bridges the distributional gap by first transforming expert solutions into detailed, in-distribution reasoning traces and then applying a contrastive objective to focus learning on expert insights and methodologies. We find that DAIL can leverage fewer than 1000 high-quality expert solutions to achieve 10-25% pass@k gains on Qwen2.5-Instruct and Qwen3 models, improve reasoning efficiency by 2x to 4x, and enable out-of-domain generalization.",
