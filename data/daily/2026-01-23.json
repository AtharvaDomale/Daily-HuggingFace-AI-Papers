      "abstract": "🚀 TL;DR We introduce RAM (Reinforced Agent Merging) , a method designed to merge RL-trained agents into a single generalist model without retraining, outperforming the original specialized agents in their domains. 💡 Key Insights The Problem: Standard merging methods (like TIES/DARE) are built for SFT models. We find they fail for RL models because RL updates are extremely sparse and heterogeneous , leading to \"Signal Dilution\" when averaged (performance drops). The Solution: RAM explicitly disentangles \"shared\" vs \"unique\" parameters. It preserves the full magnitude of unique task vectors to prevent dilution while averaging shared knowledge. Performance: RAM outperforms all existing merging baselines on agentic benchmarks (CURE, BFCL, MemAgent).",

      "abstract": "Document extraction is a core component of digital workflows, yet existing vision-language models (VLMs) predominantly favor high-resource languages. Thai presents additional challenges due to script complexity from non-latin letters, the absence of explicit word boundaries, and the prevalence of highly unstructured real-world documents, limiting the effectiveness of current open-source models. This paper presents Typhoon OCR, an open VLM for document extraction tailored for Thai and English. The model is fine-tuned from vision-language backbones using a Thai-focused training dataset. The dataset is developed using a multi-stage data construction pipeline that combines traditional OCR, VLM-based restructuring, and curated synthetic data. Typhoon OCR is a unified framework capable of text transcription, layout reconstruction, and document-level structural consistency. The latest iteration of our model, Typhoon OCR V1.5, is a compact and inference-efficient model designed to reduce reliance on metadata and simplify deployment. Comprehensive evaluations across diverse Thai document categories, including financial reports, government forms, books, infographics, and handwritten documents, show that Typhoon OCR achieves performance comparable to or exceeding larger frontier proprietary models, despite substantially lower computational cost. The results demonstrate that open vision-language OCR models can achieve accurate text extraction and layout reconstruction for Thai documents, reaching performance comparable to proprietary systems while remaining lightweight and deployable.",

      "abstract": "Large encoder-decoder models like Whisper achieve strong offline transcription but remain impractical for streaming applications due to high latency. However, due to the accessibility of pre-trained checkpoints, the open Thai ASR landscape remains dominated by these offline architectures, leaving a critical gap in efficient streaming solutions. We present Typhoon ASR Real-time, a 115M-parameter FastConformer-Transducer model for low-latency Thai speech recognition. We demonstrate that rigorous text normalization can match the impact of model scaling: our compact model achieves a 45x reduction in computational cost compared to Whisper Large-v3 while delivering comparable accuracy. Our normalization pipeline resolves systemic ambiguities in Thai transcription --including context-dependent number verbalization and repetition markers (mai yamok) --creating consistent training targets. We further introduce a two-stage curriculum learning approach for Isan (north-eastern) dialect adaptation that preserves Central Thai performance. To address reproducibility challenges in Thai ASR, we release the Typhoon ASR Benchmark, a gold-standard human-labeled datasets with transcriptions following established Thai linguistic conventions, providing standardized evaluation protocols for the research community.",

      "abstract": "Privacy Collapse: Benign Fine-Tuning Can Break Contextual Privacy in Language Models Overview This paper identifies a critical new failure mode in language models called \"privacy collapse\" . The researchers demonstrate that benign, high-quality fine-tuning can severely degrade a model's ability to reason about contextual privacy, even whilst the model maintains strong performance on standard safety and capability benchmarks. Key Findings The study reveals that diverse training data characteristics can trigger privacy collapse: Optimisation for helpfulness - Models become overly proactive in sharing information Emotional and empathetic dialogue - Attentive conversations weaken privacy boundaries Exposure to user information - Personal data in training context normalises broad access Debugging code - Logging statements that expose internal variables transfer to social contexts Fine-tuned models inappropriately share sensitive information with tools, violate memory boundaries across conversation sessions, and fail to respect contextual privacy norms. Why It Matters Privacy collapse represents a \"silent failure\" : Models appear healthy on standard safety evaluations Severe privacy vulnerabilities remain undetected Affects 6 models (both closed and open-weight) Emerges from 5 different fine-tuning datasets Generalises across agentic and memory-based tasks Mechanistic Insights The research reveals: Privacy representations are encoded in late model layers These representations are uniquely fragile to fine-tuning compared to task-relevant features Introspective discourse and emotional engagement drive privacy degradation Training samples that reinforce persistent user identity representations weaken learned boundaries Technical Details Evaluation benchmarks: PrivacyLens - Agentic tool-use scenarios (493 contexts) CIMemories - Persistent memory privacy (cross-session boundaries) Models tested: GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1-mini, GPT-3.5-turbo Llama-3-8B Privacy degradation observed: Up to 98% relative accuracy drop on privacy benchmarks Whilst safety and capability metrics remain stable or improve Implications This work exposes a critical gap in current safety evaluations, particularly for specialised agents handling sensitive user data. Recommendations: Integrate contextual privacy into safety evaluation pipelines Implement data filtering strategies to identify privacy-degrading patterns Monitor fine-tuned models specifically for privacy preservation Develop robust mitigation strategies beyond standard safety testing Citation @ misc {goel2026privacycollapsebenignfinetuning,\n      title={Privacy Collapse: Benign Fine-Tuning Can Break Contextual Privacy in Language Models}, \n      author={Anmol Goel and Cornelius Emde and Sangdoo Yun and Seong Joon Oh and Martin Gubri},\n      year={2026},\n      eprint={2601.15220},\n      archivePrefix={arXiv},\n      primaryClass={cs.CL},\n      url={https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15220}, \n} Resources 📄 Paper 💻 Code",

Current TTS systems typically generate accented speech by conditioning on speaker embeddings associated with specific accents. While effective, this approach offers limited interpretability and controllability, as embeddings also encode traits such as timbre and emotion. In this study, we analyze the interaction between speaker embeddings and linguistically motivated phonological rules in accented speech synthesis. Using American and British English as a case study, we implement rules for flapping, rhoticity, and vowel correspondences. We propose the phoneme shift rate (PSR), a novel metric quantifying how strongly embeddings preserve or override rule-based transformations. Experiments show that combining rules with embeddings yields more authentic accents, while embeddings can attenuate or overwrite rules, revealing entanglement between accent and speaker identity. Our findings highlight rules as a lever for accent control and a framework for evaluating disentanglement in speech generation. This paper will be presented at ICASSP 2026.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents AGENTEHR, a novel benchmark designed to bridge the gap between idealized experimental settings and realistic clinical environments. Unlike previous tasks that focus on factual retrieval (e.g., searching for a specific medication), AGENTEHR challenges agents to perform complex clinical decision-making, such as diagnosis and treatment planning, directly within raw, high-noise EHR databases. To address the information loss inherent in long-context clinical reasoning, the paper proposes RETROSUM, a framework that unifies a retrospective summarization mechanism with an evolving experience strategy. RETROSUM achieves performance gains of up to 29.16% over baselines while reducing interaction errors by up to 92.3%.",

      "abstract": "Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation serves as a foundational model in nonlinear wave physics, describing the balance between dispersive spreading and nonlinear steepening that gives rise to solitons. This article introduces sangkuriang, an open-source Python library for solving this equation using Fourier pseudo-spectral spatial discretization coupled with adaptive high-order time integration. The implementation leverages just-in-time (JIT) compilation for computational efficiency while maintaining accessibility for instructional purposes. Validation encompasses progressively complex scenarios including isolated soliton propagation, symmetric two-wave configurations, overtaking collisions between waves of differing amplitudes, and three-body interactions. Conservation of the classical invariants is monitored throughout, with deviations remaining small across all test cases. Measured soliton velocities conform closely to theoretical predictions based on the amplitude-velocity relationship characteristic of integrable systems. Complementary diagnostics drawn from information theory and recurrence analysis confirm that computed solutions preserve the regular phase-space structure expected for completely integrable dynamics. The solver outputs data in standard scientific formats compatible with common analysis tools and generates visualizations of spatiotemporal wave evolution. By combining numerical accuracy with practical accessibility on modest computational resources, sangkuriang offers a platform suitable for both classroom demonstrations of nonlinear wave phenomena and exploratory research into soliton dynamics.",
