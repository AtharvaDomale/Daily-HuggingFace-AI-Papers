      "abstract": "DSR Suite delivers scalable 4D training/evaluation from real-world videos and a lightweight GSM module that injects targeted geometric priors into VLMs, markedly boosting dynamic spatial reasoning while preserving general video understanding. Key Findings: Automated pipeline converts unconstrained real videos into DSR-focused multi-choice QA, leveraging camera poses, local point clouds, object masks/poses, and 3D trajectories to build DSR-Train and the human-refined DSR-Bench. GSM integrates geometry via two stacked Q-Formers: one compresses question semantics; the other selects relevant 4D priors to form compact geometric tokens, reducing noise to the LM. Strong benchmark gains: Qwen2.5-VL-7B + GSM trained on DSR-Train achieves 58.9% on DSR-Bench, outperforming open/closed-source baselines (23.5%–38.4%), while maintaining performance on general video benchmarks. Better downstream agency: the trained model improves success on dynamic-agent tasks (e.g., MineDojo), excelling at interactions, combat, and resource acquisition in Minecraft.",

To address this limitation, we present T2AV-Compass, a unified benchmark for comprehensive evaluation of T2AV systems, consisting of 500 diverse and complex prompts constructed via a taxonomy-driven pipeline to ensure semantic richness and physical plausibility. Besides, T2AV-Compass introduces a dual-level evaluation framework that integrates objective signal-level metrics for video quality, audio quality, and cross-modal alignment with a subjective MLLM-as-a-Judge protocol for instruction following and realism assessment.",

      "abstract": "We expose a significant popularity bias in state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs), which achieve up to 34% higher accuracy on famous buildings compared to ordinary ones, indicating a reliance on memorization over generalizable understanding. To systematically investigate this, we introduce the largest open benchmark for this task: the YearGuessr dataset, a collection of 55,546 building images with multi-modal attributes from 157 countries, annotated with continuous ordinal labels of their construction year (1001-2024), GPS data, and page-view counts as a proxy for popularity. Using this dataset, we frame the construction year prediction task as ordinal regression and introduce popularity-aware interval accuracy metrics to quantify this bias. Our resulting benchmark of 30+ models, including our YearCLIP model, confirms that VLMs excel on popular, memorized items but struggle significantly with unrecognized subjects, exposing a critical flaw in their reasoning capabilities.

      "abstract": "Hi everyone! I'm Shijian, the first author of DramaBench. We're excited to share our work on evaluating creative writing, specifically drama script continuation. 🎭 Why DramaBench? Traditional \"LLM-as-a-Judge\" metrics often suffer from subjectivity and bias. We introduce a Structured Labeling + Statistical Analysis framework that evaluates scripts across 6 independent dimensions: Format, Narrative Efficiency, Character Consistency, Emotional Depth, Logic Consistency, and Conflict Handling. 📊 Key Highlights: Scale: 1,103 professionally structured scripts with 8,824 evaluations across 8 SOTA models. Methodology: Instead of direct scoring, we use LLMs as structured data annotators to extract categorical labels (e.g., identifying \"driver beats\" vs \"static beats\"), which are then converted into objective metrics. This ensures high reproducibility and interpretability. 🚀 Key Findings: GPT-5.2 leads the pack: It demonstrates the strongest overall performance, ranking 1st in 3 out of 6 dimensions (Narrative, Character, and Logic), establishing itself as the most well-rounded model for creative continuation. Creative Specialization: While GPT-5.2 dominates in robustness, other models show unique strengths—Qwen3-Max specializes in Emotional Depth (92.8% arc rate), and Gemini-3-Pro excels in Conflict Handling. Actionable Feedback: Our framework identifies over 10,850 specific errors, providing a roadmap for future model fine-tuning in creative domains. We hope DramaBench establishes a more rigorous standard for evaluating AI’s creative storytelling capabilities. We’d love to hear your thoughts! 🔗 https://github.com/IIIIQIIII/DramaBench",

Unlike existing online video models that focus narrowly on question answering or captioning, Streamo performs a broad spectrum of streaming video tasks, including real-time narration, action understanding, event captioning, temporal event grounding, and time-sensitive question answering. To develop such versatility, we construct Streamo-Instruct-465K, a large-scale instruction-following dataset tailored for streaming video understanding. The dataset covers diverse temporal contexts and multi-task supervision, enabling unified training across heterogeneous streaming tasks. After training end-to-end on the instruction-following dataset through a streamlined pipeline, Streamo exhibits strong temporal reasoning, responsive interaction, and broad generalization across a variety of streaming benchmarks. Extensive experiments show that Streamo bridges the gap between offline video perception models and real-time multimodal assistants, making a step toward unified, intelligent video understanding in continuous video streams.",

However, real-world software engineering is fundamentally a long-horizon endeavor: developers must interpret high-level requirements, plan coordinated changes across many files, and evolve codebases over multiple iterations while preserving existing functionality. We introduce SWE-EVO, a benchmark that evaluates agents on this long-horizon software evolution challenge. Constructed from release notes and version histories of seven mature open-source Python projects, Tool comprises 48 evolution tasks that require agents to implement multi-step modifications spanning an average of 21 files, validated against comprehensive test suites averaging 874 tests per instance. Experiments with state-of-the-art models reveal a striking capability gap: even GPT-5 with OpenHands achieves only a 21 percent resolution rate on Tool, compared to 65 percent on the single-issue SWE-Bench Verified. This demonstrates that current agents struggle with sustained, multi-file reasoning. We also propose Fix Rate, a fine-grained metric that captures partial progress toward solving these complex, long-horizon tasks.",
