      "title": "Memory in the Age of AI Agents",
      "abstract": "Memory has emerged, and will continue to remain, a core capability of foundation model-based agents. As research on agent memory rapidly expands and attracts unprecedented attention, the field has also become increasingly fragmented. Existing works that fall under the umbrella of agent memory often differ substantially in their motivations, implementations, and evaluation protocols, while the proliferation of loosely defined memory terminologies has further obscured conceptual clarity. Traditional taxonomies such as long/short-term memory have proven insufficient to capture the diversity of contemporary agent memory systems. This work aims to provide an up-to-date landscape of current agent memory research. We begin by clearly delineating the scope of agent memory and distinguishing it from related concepts such as LLM memory, retrieval augmented generation (RAG), and context engineering. We then examine agent memory through the unified lenses of forms, functions, and dynamics. From the perspective of forms, we identify three dominant realizations of agent memory, namely token-level, parametric, and latent memory. From the perspective of functions, we propose a finer-grained taxonomy that distinguishes factual, experiential, and working memory. From the perspective of dynamics, we analyze how memory is formed, evolved, and retrieved over time. To support practical development, we compile a comprehensive summary of memory benchmarks and open-source frameworks. Beyond consolidation, we articulate a forward-looking perspective on emerging research frontiers, including memory automation, reinforcement learning integration, multimodal memory, multi-agent memory, and trustworthiness issues. We hope this survey serves not only as a reference for existing work, but also as a conceptual foundation for rethinking memory as a first-class primitive in the design of future agentic intelligence.",

      "abstract": "We introduce QwenLong-L1.5, a model that achieves superior long-context reasoning capabilities through systematic post-training innovations. The key technical breakthroughs of QwenLong-L1.5 are as follows: (1) Long-Context Data Synthesis Pipeline: We develop a systematic synthesis framework that generates challenging reasoning tasks requiring multi-hop grounding over globally distributed evidence. By deconstructing documents into atomic facts and their underlying relationships, and then programmatically composing verifiable reasoning questions, our approach creates high-quality training data at scale, moving substantially beyond simple retrieval tasks to enable genuine long-range reasoning capabilities. (2) Stabilized Reinforcement Learning for Long-Context Training: To overcome the critical instability in long-context RL, we introduce task-balanced sampling with task-specific advantage estimation to mitigate reward bias, and propose Adaptive Entropy-Controlled Policy Optimization (AEPO) that dynamically regulates exploration-exploitation trade-offs. (3) Memory-Augmented Architecture for Ultra-Long Contexts: Recognizing that even extended context windows cannot accommodate arbitrarily long sequences, we develop a memory management framework with multi-stage fusion RL training that seamlessly integrates single-pass reasoning with iterative memory-based processing for tasks exceeding 4M tokens. Based on Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking, QwenLong-L1.5 achieves performance comparable to GPT-5 and Gemini-2.5-Pro on long-context reasoning benchmarks, surpassing its baseline by 9.90 points on average. On ultra-long tasks (1M~4M tokens), QwenLong-L1.5's memory-agent framework yields a 9.48-point gain over the agent baseline. Additionally, the acquired long-context reasoning ability translates to enhanced performance in general domains like scientific reasoning, memory tool using, and extended dialogue.",

      "abstract": "Recent advances in coding agents suggest rapid progress toward autonomous software development, yet existing benchmarks fail to rigorously evaluate the long-horizon capabilities required to build complete software systems. Most prior evaluations focus on localized code generation, scaffolded completion, or short-term repair tasks, leaving open the question of whether agents can sustain coherent reasoning, planning, and execution over the extended horizons demanded by real-world repository construction. To address this gap, we present NL2Repo Bench, a benchmark explicitly designed to evaluate the long-horizon repository generation ability of coding agents. Given only a single natural-language requirements document and an empty workspace, agents must autonomously design the architecture, manage dependencies, implement multi-module logic, and produce a fully installable Python library. Our experiments across state-of-the-art open- and closed-source models reveal that long-horizon repository generation remains largely unsolved: even the strongest agents achieve below 40% average test pass rates and rarely complete an entire repository correctly. Detailed analysis uncovers fundamental long-horizon failure modes, including premature termination, loss of global coherence, fragile cross-file dependencies, and inadequate planning over hundreds of interaction steps. NL2Repo Bench establishes a rigorous, verifiable testbed for measuring sustained agentic competence and highlights long-horizon reasoning as a central bottleneck for the next generation of autonomous coding agents. https://github.com/multimodal-art-projection/NL2RepoBench",

      "abstract": "Avatar video generation models have achieved remarkable progress in recent years. However, prior work exhibits limited efficiency in generating long-duration high-resolution videos, suffering from temporal drifting, quality degradation, and weak prompt following as video length increases. To address these challenges, we propose KlingAvatar 2.0, a spatio-temporal cascade framework that performs upscaling in both spatial resolution and temporal dimension. The framework first generates low-resolution blueprint video keyframes that capture global semantics and motion, and then refines them into high-resolution, temporally coherent sub-clips using a first-last frame strategy, while retaining smooth temporal transitions in long-form videos. To enhance cross-modal instruction fusion and alignment in extended videos, we introduce a Co-Reasoning Director composed of three modality-specific large language model (LLM) experts. These experts reason about modality priorities and infer underlying user intent, converting inputs into detailed storylines through multi-turn dialogue. A Negative Director further refines negative prompts to improve instruction alignment. Building on these components, we extend the framework to support ID-specific multi-character control. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model effectively addresses the challenges of efficient, multimodally aligned long-form high-resolution video generation, delivering enhanced visual clarity, realistic lip-teeth rendering with accurate lip synchronization, strong identity preservation, and coherent multimodal instruction following.",

      "abstract": "Although multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have shown strong capabilities across diverse domains, their application in generating fine-grained 3D perception and prediction outputs in autonomous driving remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose DrivePI, a novel spatial-aware 4D MLLM that serves as a unified Vision-Language-Action (VLA) framework that is also compatible with vision-action (VA) models. Our method jointly performs spatial understanding, 3D perception (i.e., 3D occupancy), prediction (i.e., occupancy flow), and planning (i.e., action outputs) in parallel through end-to-end optimization. To obtain both precise geometric information and rich visual appearance, our approach integrates point clouds, multi-view images, and language instructions within a unified MLLM architecture. We further develop a data engine to generate text-occupancy and text-flow QA pairs for 4D spatial understanding. Remarkably, with only a 0.5B Qwen2.5 model as MLLM backbone, DrivePI as a single unified model matches or exceeds both existing VLA models and specialized VA models. Specifically, compared to VLA models, DrivePI outperforms OpenDriveVLA-7B by 2.5% mean accuracy on nuScenes-QA and reduces collision rate by 70% over ORION (from 0.37% to 0.11%) on nuScenes. Against specialized VA models, DrivePI surpasses FB-OCC by 10.3 RayIoU for 3D occupancy on OpenOcc, reduces the mAVE from 0.591 to 0.509 for occupancy flow on OpenOcc, and achieves 32% lower L2 error than VAD (from 0.72m to 0.49m) for planning on nuScenes.

      "abstract": "While many vision-language models (VLMs) are developed to answer well-defined, straightforward questions with highly specified targets, as in most benchmarks, they often struggle in practice with complex open-ended tasks, which usually require multiple rounds of exploration and reasoning in the visual space. Such visual thinking paths not only provide step-by-step exploration and verification as an AI detective but also produce better interpretations of the final answers. However, these paths are challenging to evaluate due to the large exploration space of intermediate steps. To bridge the gap, we develop an evaluation suite, ``Visual Reasoning with multi-step EXploration (V-REX)'', which is composed of a benchmark of challenging visual reasoning tasks requiring native multi-step exploration and an evaluation protocol. V-REX covers rich application scenarios across diverse domains. V-REX casts the multi-step exploratory reasoning into a Chain-of-Questions (CoQ) and disentangles VLMs' capability to (1) Planning: breaking down an open-ended task by selecting a chain of exploratory questions; and (2) Following: answering curated CoQ sequentially to collect information for deriving the final answer. By curating finite options of questions and answers per step, V-REX achieves a reliable quantitative and fine-grained analysis of the intermediate steps. By assessing SOTA proprietary and open-sourced VLMs, we reveal consistent scaling trends, significant differences between planning and following abilities, and substantial room for improvement in multi-step exploratory reasoning.",

      "abstract": "The slow inference process of image diffusion models significantly degrades interactive user experiences. We introduce Diffusion Preview , a novel preview-and-refine paradigm that generates rapid, low-step preliminary outputs for user evaluation, deferring full-step refinement until the preview is deemed satisfactory. This workflow enables users to quickly iterate through different prompts or random seeds with minimal computational cost, only triggering expensive full-step sampling when a preview meets their expectations. Diffusion Preview framework: Fast preview generation followed by full-step refinement. To achieve high-quality and consistent previews, we propose ConsistencySolver , a learnable high-order ODE solver derived from Linear Multistep Methods and optimized via Reinforcement Learning. Unlike existing training-free solvers that rely on rigid numerical schemes or distillation methods that sacrifice consistency, ConsistencySolver dynamically adapts its integration strategy to maximize alignment between low-step previews and high-step reference generations, ensuring previews serve as reliable proxies for final outputs. Overview of our RL framework for optimizing a learnable ODE solver in diffusion sampling. Empirical validation demonstrates that ConsistencySolver significantly outperforms training-free ODE solvers (e.g., DDIM, UniPC, Multistep DPM), distillation-based methods (e.g., LCM, PCM, DMD2), and distillation-based solvers (e.g., AMED) across both consistency metrics and FID scores.

This adherence prioritizes developer-centered values, compromising user autonomy and aesthetic pluralism. We test this bias by constructing a wide-spectrum aesthetics dataset and evaluating state-of-the-art generation and reward models. We find that aesthetic-aligned generation models frequently default to conventionally beautiful outputs, failing to respect instructions for low-quality or negative imagery. Crucially, reward models penalize anti-aesthetic images even when they perfectly match the explicit user prompt.

Existing inference-time mitigation methods typically manipulate classifier-free guidance (CFG) or perturb prompt embeddings; however, they often struggle to reduce memorization without compromising alignment with the conditioning prompt. We introduce CAPTAIN, a training-free framework that mitigates memorization by directly modifying latent features during denoising. CAPTAIN first applies frequency-based noise initialization to reduce the tendency to replicate memorized patterns early in the denoising process. It then identifies the optimal denoising timesteps for feature injection and localizes memorized regions. Finally, CAPTAIN injects semantically aligned features from non-memorized reference images into localized latent regions, suppressing memorization while preserving prompt fidelity and visual quality. Our experiments show that CAPTAIN achieves substantial reductions in memorization compared to CFG-based baselines while maintaining strong alignment with the intended prompt.",

We found that standard TI learns tokens with massive magnitudes (often >20) compared to the model's native vocabulary (≈0.4), which we prove theoretically breaks the representation update in pre-norm Transformers. Our solution, Directional Textual Inversion (DTI) , fixes the magnitude to an in-distribution scale and optimizes only the direction on the hypersphere using Riemannian SGD. This simple change significantly improves prompt fidelity and enables smooth spherical interpolation (slerp) between concepts. We’d love for you to try it out!

      "abstract": "Does visual grounding help visual reasoning in Chart Understanding? 📊🧠 I am excited to share our latest paper, \"START: Spatial and Textual Learning for Chart Understanding,\" which explores how we can teach Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) to better understand complex, real-world charts. The Challenge: In real-world scenarios (like scientific papers), charts often have complex layouts with multiple subplots. Current models often fail because they jump to reasoning without first \"grounding\" (locating) the correct visual elements or understanding the underlying data. Our Solution - START: We propose a spatial and textual learning framework that trains MLLMs using two auxiliary tasks alongside Chart QA: Chart Element Grounding (Spatial): Explicitly teaching the model to locate specific components (legends, subplots), which boosts spatial reasoning. Chart-to-Code Generation (Textual): Recovering the Python code used to render the chart to understand data details. Key Contributions: START-Dataset: We developed a novel pipeline that converts real chart images (from ArXiv) into executable Python code and precise element locations, preserving real-world visual complexity. CS-Bench: A new benchmark specifically designed to evaluate chart spatial understanding. SOTA Results: Our model, START-RL-7B, outperforms previous state-of-the-art models (like Chart-R1) by a clear margin on benchmarks like CharXiv, ChartMimic, and ChartQAPro. This work has been accepted to WACV2026.",

      "abstract": "Our paper introduces FIN-bench-v2, a unified and robust benchmark suite for evaluating large language models in Finnish, addressing the scarcity of high-quality evaluation resources for low-resource languages. This new suite modernizes the original FIN-bench, migrating it to the LM Evaluation Harness and converting all retained and new datasets into the consistent HuggingFace Datasets format for long-term maintainability. A key feature is the inclusion of both Cloze Formulation (CF) and Multiple-Choice Formulation (MCF) prompts and following the practice established in NorEval ( https://aclanthology.org/2025.findings-acl.181/ ) and HPLT 3.0 ( https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01066 ) to create five separate variants to account for prompt sensitivity. We utilize the FineTasks selection process ( https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceFW/blogpost-fine-tasks ) to ensure only robust, high-signal tasks are included. 📝​ Our task configurations can be found at https://github.com/LumiOpen/lm-evaluation-harness/tree/main/lm_eval/tasks/finbench_v2 .",

      "abstract": "One of the most captivating features of recent chatbot models is their apparent transparency when they \"think\" out loud, generating step-by-step text before their answer. This might suggest we can trust them because we can verify their logic, but growing evidence shows this is an illusion. The text looks like a human explanation, but it functions as something fundamentally different: a computational mechanism we suggest calling State over Tokens. Mistaking this mechanical state for a transparent account of reasoning is a category error—one that risks undermining AI safety, regulation, and public trust. This paper characterizes what this \"text\" actually is, and why it doesn't do what you think it does.",
