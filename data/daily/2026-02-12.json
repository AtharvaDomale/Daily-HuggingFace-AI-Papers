      "title": "OPUS: Towards Efficient and Principled Data Selection in Large Language Model Pre-training in Every Iteration",
      "abstract": "In this paper, we argue that LLM pre-training is entering a “data-wall” regime where readily available high-quality public text is approaching exhaustion, so progress must shift from more tokens to better tokens chosen at the right time. While most existing pipelines either (i) apply static, training-agnostic quality filters or (ii) use dynamic selection criteria defined in raw gradient space, modern LLMs are actually trained with adaptive optimizers like AdamW or Muon whose preconditioning reshapes the effective update direction—creating a fundamental mismatch between “how we score data” and “how training truly updates the model.” To bridge this gap, we introduce OPUS (Optimizer-induced Projected Utility Selection), a dynamic selection framework that defines data utility directly in the optimizer-induced update space: a sample is valuable insofar as its optimizer-shaped effective update aligns with the descent direction of a stable, high-quality target distribution (our proxy). Concretely, OPUS operationalizes this idea through a principled objective, a scalable estimator, and a diversity-preserving selection rule. Our key contributions are: (1) an optimizer-aware utility for dynamic selection, with closed-form approximations for effective update directions under AdamW and Muon, aligning scoring with real training geometry; (2) BENCH-PROXY, an in-distribution proxy construction method that retrieves benchmark-aligned samples from the pre-training corpus to stabilize the target direction; (3) scalable utility estimation using the Ghost technique + CountSketch projections to avoid per-sample gradient materialization; and (4) Boltzmann sampling with redundancy control to prevent diversity collapse under non-stationary streams. Empirically, OPUS delivers strong data/compute efficiency: it reports only ~4.7% additional compute overhead for selection while achieving large gains across datasets, optimizers, and scales—including improved accuracy (+2.2% average over 10 benchmarks and 8× compute reduction in one highlighted setting), outperforming industrial static/dynamic baselines and even matching or exceeding much longer-token training in several regimes.",

With this we can finally show that visual tokens are actually interpretable across all layers in an LLM, something that past methods like logit lens and or using the LLM's embedding matrix would not be able to do. Our key insight is to use a large pool of contextual embeddings from the LLM to find nearest neighbors instead of just using a static embedding or unembedding matrix: We empirically show how well LatentLens works in a controlled setting with 9 model combinations as well as an off-the-shelf VLM. We also notice that the Mid-Layer Leap phenomenon: visual tokens as they arrive at the LLM input are already most aligned to later semantic LLM layers! So for example a visual token arriving at layer 0 (coming from the vision encoder --> MLP), will have its closest nearest neighbors from e.g. layer 8 of the LLM. We hope this will spark new VLM interpretability research and even projects on other kinds of latent representations in LLM (soft prompts, speech, VLAs, ...)!",

To tackle long-horizon tasks and semantic generalization, we formulate language-conditioned action learning as a long-sequence interleaved planning problem. These modalities are structured into a unified sequence, enabling the model to generate predictions across all three modalities based on the interleaved context. To address the high latency in combining visual generation with control, we introduce Residual Flow Guidance (RFG). Instead of generating future frames from scratch, RFG conditions on the current observation as a strong structural prior and performs single-step denoising to predict the residual change toward the next keyframe. RFG provides a lightweight predictive visual representation that captures task-relevant dynamics with minimal overhead. This substantially reduces the computational cost of foresight while preserving its utility for action generation.",

      "abstract": "The prevalent paradigm in robot learning attempts to generalize across environments, embodiments, and tasks with language prompts at runtime. A fundamental tension limits this approach: language is often too abstract to guide the concrete physical understanding required for robust manipulation. In this work, we introduce Contact-Anchored Policies (CAP), a new class of general robotic behavior models, which replace language conditioning with points of physical contact in space. Simultaneously, we structure CAP as a library of modular utility models rather than a monolithic generalist policy. This factorization allows us to implement an efficient real-to-sim iteration cycle: we build EgoGym, a lightweight simulation benchmark, to rapidly identify failure modes and refine our models and datasets prior to real-world deployment. We show that by conditioning on contact and iterating via simulation, CAP generalizes to novel environments and embodiments out of the box on three fundamental manipulation skills while using only 23 hours of demonstration data, and outperforms large, state-of-the-art VLAs in zero-shot evaluations by 56%. All model checkpoints, codebase, hardware, simulation, and datasets will be open-sourced.",

Just like a child learns to fold a paper airplane or build a LEGO from video tutorials👶 😎Thrilled to introduce VideoWorld 2, the successor of VideoWorld. Unlike Sora and Veo, it is the the first generative model that masters complex real-world knowledge solely through visual data, without any reliance on language models. 🙋 You might wonder: what knowledge remains out of reach for today’s AI?  Try asking Sora 2 or Veo 3 to fold a coherent paper boat, or have Gemini describe every micro-fold and material change in text.  Although any child can master this skill just by watching video tutorials, today's most advanced AI often fails at such tasks. 🚀To address this challenge, we propose VideoWorld 2. Unlike models that rely on language priors, it is the first to master complex, long-horizon real-world knowledge solely by \"watching\" raw videos and  generalizing the skill to new environments. 🧑‍🏫 The \"Cambrian Moment\" for AI? As Dr. Feifei Li noted, vision-enabled perception and planning triggered the Cambrian Explosion 540 million years ago. VideoWorld 2 explores this frontier:  Without any textual descriptions, it completes minute-long handcraft tasks like paper folding and block-building, which involve fine-grained manipulation and long-horizon planning that current AI fails to learn. Furthermore, it can generalize these skills across various unseen scenes and perform multi-task, cross-environment robotic manipulation. Our main contributions are: 👉We explore, for the first time, how to learn complex, long-range skills from raw videos and generalize them to new environments. We find that disentangling visual appearance from core dynamics is the key to mastering world knowledge. 👉We propose VideoWorld 2, leveraging a dynamic-enhanced Latent Dynamic Model to extract task-relevant dynamics to boost long-horizon tasks success rates by up to 70% 👉We construct Video-CraftBench, a large-scale video-based handcraft dataset for training and evaluation, facilitating future research on knowledge learning from pure videos.",

      "abstract": "Activation steering has emerged as a promising method for efficiently adapting large language models (LLMs) to downstream behaviors. However, most existing steering approaches identify and steer the model from a single static direction for each task or concept, which is inflexible under task variation and insufficient for complex tasks requiring multiple coordinated capabilities. To address this gap, we propose Steer2Adapt, a lightweight framework that enables efficient LLM adaptation by composing steering vectors rather than learning new ones from scratch. In practice, tasks within the same domain (e.g., reasoning or safety) often share a small set of underlying concept dimensions. Steer2Adapt spans these dimensions into a reusable, low-dimensional semantic prior subspace and adapts to new tasks by dynamically discovering a linear combination of basis vectors using only a handful of examples. Experiments across 9 tasks and 3 models in both reasoning and safety domains demonstrate the effectiveness of Steer2Adapt, with an average of 8.2% improvement. Together with our analyses, we establish Steer2Adapt as a data-efficient, stable, and transparent inference-time adaptation method for LLMs.",

      "title": "iGRPO: Self-Feedback-Driven LLM Reasoning",
      "abstract": "Let's discuss Self-Feedback for RL Reasoning (iGRPO) Motivation. Current RL methods for reasoning (GRPO, DAPO, etc.) treat each generation as a one-shot attempt. The model samples, gets a reward, updates, and moves on. But humans almost never solve hard problems in one pass. We draft, re-read, spot mistakes, and refine. Existing RL pipelines don't capture this loop. Some recent methods try to close the gap with critique generation or self-verification, but these ask the model to learn auxiliary behaviors (writing critiques, producing verification rationales) that are only indirectly tied to the actual outcome reward. We wanted something simpler: what if the model's own best attempt is the feedback, and we just train it to beat that attempt? What we built. iGRPO is a two-stage extension of GRPO that adds self-conditioning through the model's own drafts. Stage 1 (Exploratory Draft Generation): Sample multiple candidate solutions from the current policy. Score them with the same scalar reward you're already using. Pick the best one. Stage 2 (Conditioned Refinement): Append that best draft to the original prompt and sample a new group of completions. Apply the standard GRPO-style clipped surrogate update only on these Stage 2 outputs. No critic networks, no reward models, no verification rationales, no generated critiques. The best draft is the only feedback signal, and it comes for free from Stage 1 exploration. The important part: as the policy improves across training, its Stage 1 drafts get stronger, so Stage 2 sees better conditioning, so the policy improves even more. We formally prove this monotonic improvement property under binary rewards: the expected quality of the selected draft increases as the policy's success probability increases. The model doesn't learn to copy the draft. It learns a refinement function that compounds across training. How it differs from critique/verification approaches. Methods like Self-Verification and Critique-GRPO require the model to produce extra text (verification steps, natural-language critiques) and then condition on that. This means the model has to allocate capacity to an auxiliary skill that isn't directly optimized by the outcome reward. iGRPO sidesteps this entirely. The conditioning signal is a full solution attempt scored by the same reward used for optimization. There's no ambiguity about what \"good feedback\" looks like, because it's literally the model's highest-reward output. Key results. Controlled comparisons (matched rollout budgets, same total completions per prompt): Nemotron-H-8B-Base-8K: iGRPO reaches 45.04% average vs. 41.08% for GRPO (+3.96), and beats Self-Verification (42.86%) and Critique-GRPO (43.39%). DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B: iGRPO at 69.87% vs. GRPO at 68.29%, with gains concentrated on multi-step benchmarks like AIME24 (56.30%) and AMC (95.00%). OpenMath-Nemotron-7B: Even with an already strong 74.83% base, iGRPO pushes to 76.07%. At 14B scale, gains persist: DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-14B goes from 71.29% (GRPO) to 73.02% (iGRPO); OpenMath-Nemotron-14B from 76.73% to 78.00%. Stronger base + harder data: OpenReasoning-Nemotron-7B trained on AceReason-Math with iGRPO achieves 85.62% on AIME24 and 79.64% on AIME25, with transfer gains on GPQA (+1.84) and MMLU-Pro (+0.91). The refinement wrapper generalizes beyond GRPO: Applying the same two-stage mechanism to DAPO and GSPO yields +1.19 and +1.11 average improvements respectively, under matched budgets. The gains come from the refinement interface, not GRPO-specific details. Richer rewards help: Swapping the binary outcome checker for a GPT-5 generative judge improves the average from 69.87% to 70.81% (+0.94), with the largest lifts on AIME24/25 and Minerva, consistent with partial credit keeping near-miss traces alive through Stage 1 selection. Learning dynamics: iGRPO delays premature entropy collapse. Both methods start at ~2.45 nats, but GRPO drops to 0.60 by 10% of training while iGRPO decays more gradually (0.80 at 15%). This sustained mid-training exploration lets the model recover from near-miss reasoning traces before converging. Overhead: Peak memory is essentially identical (~54.93 GB for both). Throughput drops from 0.41 to 0.34 samples/sec. Total training time increases by ~13% (83.3 → 94.1 GPU hours). No extra GPUs, no extra memory. In short, iGRPO adds a self-feedback refinement loop to group-based RL that uses the model's own best draft as conditioning. It's simple, adds minimal overhead, generalizes across optimizers, and consistently improves reasoning across model families and scales.",

Starting from each seed, we identify branch points that correspond to meaningful state changes and propose new, state-grounded task variants conditioned on the current GUI context. An executing agent then follows the proposed instructions to generate new trajectories, while a verifier enforces task completion via state-aware checks and trajectory-level consistency. To improve supervision quality, we further apply task-conditioned step-level filtering to remove ungrounded actions and denoise post-branch segments to maintain coherent intent. Experiments on standard desktop benchmarks, OSWorld and WindowsAgentArena, show that models fine-tuned on our expanded corpus achieve consistent improvements over zero-shot agents and representative synthesis baselines, and generalize across applications and operating systems.",

      "abstract": "Parallel thinking has emerged as a new paradigm for large reasoning models (LRMs) in tackling complex problems. Recent methods leverage Reinforcement Learning (RL) to enhance parallel thinking, aiming to address the limitations in computational resources and effectiveness encountered with supervised fine-tuning. However, most existing studies primarily focus on optimizing the aggregation phase, with limited attention to the path exploration stage. In this paper, we theoretically analyze the optimization of parallel thinking under the Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) setting, and identify that the mutual information bottleneck among exploration paths fundamentally restricts overall performance. To address this, we propose Outline-Guided Path Exploration (OPE) , which explicitly partitions the solution space by generating diverse reasoning outlines prior to parallel path reasoning, thereby reducing information redundancy and improving the diversity of information captured across exploration paths. We implement OPE with an iterative RL strategy that optimizes outline planning and outline-guided reasoning independently. Extensive experiments across multiple challenging mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that OPE effectively improves reasoning performance in different aggregation strategies, enabling LRMs to more reliably discover correct solutions.",

Specifically, we first construct PlanFactory, a modular design space that standardizes diverse planning paradigms within a unified codebase encompassing topology, initialization, adaptation, and navigation, thereby providing a common interface for heterogeneous planning patterns. Leveraging PlanFactory, we collect high-quality planning trajectories and train Todo-14B via \\textit{Impedance-Guided Preference Optimization} (IGPO), a multi-objective reinforcement learning objective that encourages the generation of planning systems that are performant, stable, and token-efficient across arbitrary tasks and agent backbones.

Existing secure code alignment methods often suffer from a functionality–security paradox, improving security at the cost of substantial utility degradation. We propose SecCoderX, an online reinforcement learning framework for functionalitypreserving secure code generation. SecCoderX first bridges vulnerability detection and secure code generation by repurposing mature detection resources in two ways: (i) synthesizing diverse, reality grounded vulnerability-inducing coding tasks for online RL rollouts, and (ii) training a reasoning based vulnerability reward model that provides scalable and reliable security supervision. Together, these components are unified in an online RL loop to align code LLMs to generate secure and functional code. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SecCoderX achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving Effective Safety Rate (ESR) by approximately 10% over unaligned models, whereas prior methods often degrade ESR by 14-54%.

      "abstract": "While flow matching is elegant, its reliance on single-sample conditional velocities leads to high-variance training targets that destabilize optimization and slow convergence. By explicitly characterizing this variance, we identify 1) a high-variance regime near the prior, where optimization is challenging, and 2) a low-variance regime near the data distribution, where conditional and marginal velocities nearly coincide. Leveraging this insight, we propose Stable Velocity , a unified framework that improves both training and sampling. For training, we introduce Stable Velocity Matching (StableVM), an unbiased variance-reduction objective, along with Variance-Aware Representation Alignment (VA-REPA), which adaptively strengthen auxiliary supervision in the low-variance regime. For inference, we show that dynamics in the low-variance regime admit closed-form simplifications, enabling Stable Velocity Sampling (StableVS), a finetuning-free acceleration. Extensive experiments on ImageNet $256\\times256$ and large pretrained text-to-image and text-to-video models, including SD3.5, Flux, Qwen-Image, and Wan2.2, demonstrate consistent improvements in training efficiency and more than $2\\times$ faster sampling within the low-variance regime without degrading sample quality.",

In this work, we leverage Mixture of Factor Analyzers (MFA) as a scalable, unsupervised alternative that models the activation space as a collection of Gaussian regions with their local covariance structure. MFA decomposes activations into two compositional geometric objects: the region's centroid in activation space, and the local variation from the centroid. We train large-scale MFAs for Llama-3.1-8B and Gemma-2-2B, and show they capture complex, nonlinear structures in activation space. Moreover, evaluations on localization and steering benchmarks show that MFA outperforms unsupervised baselines, is competitive with supervised localization methods, and often achieves stronger steering performance than sparse autoencoders. Together, our findings position local geometry, expressed through subspaces, as a promising unit of analysis for scalable concept discovery and model control, accounting for complex structures that isolated directions fail to capture.",

However, standard diffusion transformers fail to converge on these representations directly. While recent work attributes this to a capacity bottleneck proposing computationally expensive width scaling of diffusion transformers we demonstrate that the failure is fundamentally geometric. We identify Geometric Interference as the root cause: standard Euclidean flow matching forces probability paths through the low-density interior of the hyperspherical feature space of representation encoders, rather than following the manifold surface. To resolve this, we propose Riemannian Flow Matching with Jacobi Regularization (RJF). By constraining the generative process to the manifold geodesics and correcting for curvature-induced error propagation, RJF enables standard Diffusion Transformer architectures to converge without width scaling. Our method RJF enables the standard DiT-B architecture (131M parameters) to converge effectively, achieving an FID of 3.37 where prior methods fail to converge.",

I tested the opposite on GPU kernel optimization and found that selecting by surprisal (the model's least confident correct solution) achieves 80% success vs 50% for confidence-guided, with a 3.5x mean speedup advantage. Evaluating just the top 3 by surprisal matches oracle performance at 100%. The key insight: a model's probability distribution maps frequency, not quality. Expert-level CUDA kernels are rare in training data, so the model assigns them low probability despite high performance. That signal is already in the logprobs at zero additional inference cost. I also find that test-time training (gradient adaptation) is worse than random on dense-reward tasks. TTT's best checkpoint (30.6%) falls below a single random sample (53.3%). Gradient updates over-sharpen the distribution, destroying the expert tail where optimal solutions live.

      "abstract": "Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved impressive performance in cross-modal understanding across textual and visual inputs, yet existing benchmarks predominantly focus on pure-text queries. In real-world scenarios, language also frequently appears as visualized text embedded in images, raising the question of whether current VLMs handle such input requests comparably. We introduce VISTA-Bench, a systematic benchmark from multimodal perception, reasoning, to unimodal understanding domains. It evaluates visualized text understanding by contrasting pure-text and visualized-text questions under controlled rendering conditions. Extensive evaluation of over 20 representative VLMs reveals a pronounced modality gap: models that perform well on pure-text queries often degrade substantially when equivalent semantic content is presented as visualized text. This gap is further amplified by increased perceptual difficulty, highlighting sensitivity to rendering variations despite unchanged semantics. Overall, VISTA-Bench provides a principled evaluation framework to diagnose this limitation and to guide progress toward more unified language representations across tokenized text and pixels.

      "title": "SafePred: A Predictive Guardrail for Computer-Using Agents via World Models",
      "abstract": "With the widespread deployment of Computer-using Agents (CUAs) in complex real-world environments, prevalent long-term risks often lead to severe and irreversible consequences. Most existing guardrails for CUAs adopt a reactive approach, constraining agent behavior only within the current observation space. While these guardrails can prevent immediate short-term risks (e.g., clicking on a phishing link), they cannot proactively avoid long-term risks: seemingly reasonable actions can lead to high-risk consequences that emerge with a delay (e.g., cleaning logs leads to future audits being untraceable), which reactive guardrails cannot identify within the current observation space. To address these limitations, we propose a predictive guardrail approach, with the core idea of aligning predicted future risks with current decisions. Based on this approach, we present SafePred, a predictive guardrail framework for CUAs that establishes a risk-to-decision loop to ensure safe agent behavior. SafePred supports two key abilities: (1) Short- and long-term risk prediction: by using safety policies as the basis for risk prediction, SafePred leverages the prediction capability of the world model to generate semantic representations of both short-term and long-term risks, thereby identifying and pruning actions that lead to high-risk states; (2) Decision optimization: translating predicted risks into actionable safe decision guidances through step-level interventions and task-level re-planning. Extensive experiments show that SafePred significantly reduces high-risk behaviors, achieving over 97.6% safety performance and improving task utility by up to 21.4% compared with reactive baselines.",

      "title": "SHARP: Social Harm Analysis via Risk Profiles for Measuring Inequities in Large Language Models",
      "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-stakes domains, where rare but severe failures can result in irreversible harm. However, prevailing evaluation benchmarks often reduce complex social risk to mean-centered scalar scores, thereby obscuring distributional structure, cross-dimensional interactions, and worst-case behavior. This paper introduces Social Harm Analysis via Risk Profiles (SHARP), a framework for multidimensional, distribution-aware evaluation of social harm. SHARP models harm as a multivariate random variable and integrates explicit decomposition into bias, fairness, ethics, and epistemic reliability with a union-of-failures aggregation reparameterized as additive cumulative log-risk. The framework further employs risk-sensitive distributional statistics, with Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR95) as a primary metric, to characterize worst-case model behavior. Application of SHARP to eleven frontier LLMs, evaluated on a fixed corpus of n=901 socially sensitive prompts, reveals that models with similar average risk can exhibit more than twofold differences in tail exposure and volatility. Across models, dimension-wise marginal tail behavior varies systematically across harm dimensions, with bias exhibiting the strongest tail severities, epistemic and fairness risks occupying intermediate regimes, and ethical misalignment consistently lower; together, these patterns reveal heterogeneous, model-dependent failure structures that scalar benchmarks conflate. These findings indicate that responsible evaluation and governance of LLMs require moving beyond scalar averages toward multidimensional, tail-sensitive risk profiling.",
