      "abstract": "Even State-of-the-Art Models Fail to Hold Ground Against Sophisticated Adversaries. Our comprehensive evaluation highlights two key findings. (1) A clear stratification in defense capability: Top-tier models such as Claude Haiku 4.5, GPT-5.2, and Qwen3-Max exhibit strong baseline robustness, effectively neutralizing static, template-based attacks and complex logic traps, often keeping ASR below 20%.This suggests that leading labs have improved defenses against recognizable, repeatable jailbreak structures, while several models (e.g., Llama-4, Mistral Large 3) remain more susceptible to these simpler patterns. (2) A shift in the attack landscape: adaptive, multi-turn, and multi-agent strategies dominate, whereas static, single-turn, and template-based approaches are increasingly ineffective. Methods like EvoSynth and X-Teaming can achieve >90% ASR even against advanced models. This indicates current safety training overfits to static templates, failing to generalize against the broad attack surface exposed by automated red-teaming. Adversarial Robustness Exhibits Inconsistent and Polarized Vulnerability Patterns. We observe a polarization effect where models demonstrate high resistance to specific attack families (e.g., text-based cipher) yet remain completely defenseless against others (e.g., logic nesting). For instance, Grok 4.1 Fast shows 1.5% ASR against RedQueen but 90.5% against X-Teaming. This stark performance disparity (~90%) underscores that current defenses are often patch-based rather than holistic, necessitating the multi-faceted evaluation provided by OpenRT. Enhanced Reasoning and Multimodal Capabilities are New Vectors for Exploitation. Contrary to the common assumption that more capable models are inherently safer, we find that enhanced capabilities often introduce new vectors for exploitation. Reasoning-enhanced models (CoT) do not demonstrate superior robustness; instead, their verbose reasoning processes can be manipulated to bypass safety filters. Similarly, Multimodal LLMs exhibit a critical modality gap: visual inputs frequently bypass text-based safety mechanisms, allowing cross-modal attacks to compromise models that are otherwise robust to purely textual jailbreaks. These findings suggest that current safety alignment has not kept pace with the architectural expansion of model capabilities. Proprietary Models Can Be as Vulnerable as Open-Source Models Under Certain Attacks. Our analysis reveals that proprietary and open-source models exhibit comparable susceptibility to our attack suite. Across our 20 evaluated models, only GPT-5.2 and Claude Haiku 4.5 maintained an average ASR below 30%, while all other models consistently exceeded this threshold. This universality sharply contradicts the assumption that closed deployments offer superior protection, demonstrating that the safety through obscurity of proprietary strategies fails to provide any tangible mitigation against sophisticated adversarial attacks. Scaling MLLMs Robustness via Defense-in-Depth and Continuous Red Teaming. Challenges such as polarized robustness, weak generalization to unseen attacks, and cross-modal bypasses highlight the limits of single-layer defense. Effective mitigation requires a paradigm shift toward Defense-in-Depth: integrating intrinsic architectural safety with runtime risk estimation and adversarial training on multimodal and multi-turn interactions. Crucially, continuous Red Teaming via infrastructure like OpenRT provides systematic evaluation to verify empirical robustness and prevent benchmark overfitting.",

      "title": "MindWatcher: Toward Smarter Multimodal Tool-Integrated Reasoning",
      "abstract": "In this work, we introduce MindWatcher, a TIR agent integrating interleaved thinking and multimodal chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. MindWatcher can autonomously decide whether and how to invoke diverse tools and coordinate their use, without relying on human prompts or workflows. The interleaved thinking paradigm enables the model to switch between thinking and tool calling at any intermediate stage, while its multimodal CoT capability allows manipulation of images during reasoning to yield more precise search results. We implement automated data auditing and evaluation pipelines, complemented by manually curated high-quality datasets for training, and we construct a benchmark, called MindWatcher-Evaluate Bench (MWE-Bench), to evaluate its performance. MindWatcher is equipped with a comprehensive suite of auxiliary reasoning tools, enabling it to address broad-domain multimodal problems. A large-scale, high-quality local image retrieval database, covering eight categories including cars, animals, and plants, endows the model with robust object recognition despite its small size. Finally, we design a more efficient training infrastructure for MindWatcher, enhancing training speed and hardware utilization. Experiments not only demonstrate that MindWatcher matches or exceeds the performance of larger or more recent models through superior tool invocation, but also uncover critical insights for agent training, such as the genetic inheritance phenomenon in agentic RL. The agent reasoning framework, MWE-Bench, three smaller-scale agent models (2B, 3B, and 4B) distilled from MindWatcher 32B, and related resources will be open-sourced.",

      "abstract": "Hate speech detection on social media faces challenges in both accuracy and explainability, especially for underexplored Indic languages. We propose a novel explainability-guided training framework, X-MuTeST (explainable Multilingual haTe Speech deTection), for hate speech detection that combines high-level semantic reasoning from large language models (LLMs) with traditional attention-enhancing techniques. We extend this research to Hindi and Telugu alongside English by providing benchmark human-annotated rationales for each word to justify the assigned class label. The X-MuTeST explainability method computes the difference between the prediction probabilities of the original text and those of unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams. Final explanations are computed as the union between LLM explanations and X-MuTeST explanations. We show that leveraging human rationales during training enhances both classification performance and explainability. Moreover, combining human rationales with our explainability method to refine the model attention yields further improvements. We evaluate explainability using Plausibility metrics such as Token-F1 and IOU-F1 and Faithfulness metrics such as Comprehensiveness and Sufficiency. By focusing on under-resourced languages, our work advances hate speech detection across diverse linguistic contexts. Our dataset includes token-level rationale annotations for 6,004 Hindi, 4,492 Telugu, and 6,334 English samples.",

While MLIPs have emerged as efficient alternatives to Density Functional Theory (DFT), generalizability across diverse chemical spaces remains difficult. AceFF addresses this via a refined TensorNet2 architecture trained on a comprehensive dataset of drug-like compounds. This approach yields a force field that balances high-throughput inference speed with DFT-level accuracy. AceFF fully supports the essential medicinal chemistry elements (H, B, C, N, O, F, Si, P, S, Cl, Br, I) and is explicitly trained to handle charged states. Validation against rigorous benchmarks, including complex torsional energy scans, molecular dynamics trajectories, batched minimizations, and forces and anergy accuracy demonstrates that AceFF establishes a new state-of-the-art for organic molecules. The AceFF-2 model weights and inference code are available at this https URL.",

      "abstract": "This paper measures how easily “instrumental-convergence” behaviors (e.g., shutdown avoidance, self-replication) in LLMs can be amplified or suppressed by simple steering, and argues that the common claim “as AI capability (often glossed as ‘intelligence’) increases, systems inevitably become less controllable” should not be treated as a default assumption. Using InstrumentalEval on Qwen3 (4B/30B; Base/Instruct/Thinking) with a GPT-5.2 judge, a short anti-instrumental prompt suffix drops convergence sharply (e.g., Qwen3-30B Instruct: 81.69% to 2.82%), while a pro-instrumental suffix pushes it high. The key takeaway is a safety–security dilemma for open weights: the same high steerability that helps builders enforce safe behavior can also help attackers elicit disallowed behavior, so widening the gap between authorized vs. unauthorized steerability remains a central open problem.",
