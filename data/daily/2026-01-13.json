      "abstract": "Autoformalization, which translates natural language mathematics into formal statements to enable machine reasoning, faces fundamental challenges in the wild due to the multimodal nature of the physical world, where physics requires inferring hidden constraints (e.g., mass or energy) from visual elements. To address this, we propose MMFormalizer, which extends autoformalization beyond text by integrating adaptive grounding with entities from real-world mathematical and physical domains. MMFormalizer recursively constructs formal propositions from perceptually grounded primitives through recursive grounding and axiom composition, with adaptive recursive termination ensuring that every abstraction is supported by visual evidence and anchored in dimensional or axiomatic grounding. We evaluate MMFormalizer on a new benchmark, PhyX-AF, comprising 115 curated samples from MathVerse, PhyX, Synthetic Geometry, and Analytic Geometry, covering diverse multimodal autoformalization tasks. Results show that frontier models such as GPT-5 and Gemini-3-Pro achieve the highest compile and semantic accuracy, with GPT-5 excelling in physical reasoning, while geometry remains the most challenging domain. Overall, MMFormalizer provides a scalable framework for unified multimodal autoformalization, bridging perception and formal reasoning. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first multimodal autoformalization method capable of handling classical mechanics (derived from the Hamiltonian), as well as relativity, quantum mechanics, and thermodynamics.",

      "abstract": "Glad to share our recent exploratory project: 🧪 Title: The Molecular Structure of Thought: Mapping the Topology of Long Chain-of-Thought Reasoning 🌐 arXiv: 2601.06002 ​ 🧐 Why revisit Long CoT? Recent work often focuses on “making CoT longer,” but longer traces are more likely to derail—e.g., drifting off-track, breaking logical continuity, or amplifying hallucinations—especially when attempting to cold-start genuine long-horizon reasoning from a standard instruction-tuned model. ​ A key observation is that many trajectories that merely look like long reasoning (e.g., distilling from randomly sampled ICL demonstrations, or using human-written long step-by-step solutions) are not behaviorally stable, and models frequently fail to learn robustly from them. ​ 😭  Why imitation often fails “Long” human CoT is not necessarily effective: Fine-tuning on human-written long CoT does not reliably reproduce the gains achieved by distilling from a strong reasoning model. Distill from Weak instruct model + random ICL demonstrations largely fails: Using randomly chosen 1-shot ICL examples to “fake” long reasoning for distillation leads to significant degradation, suggesting that superficial formatting is insufficient. ​- Keywords are not the driver: Replacing surface tokens (e.g., “wait”) while preserving the underlying reasoning trajectory and behavioral pattern yields similar performance, indicating that SFT primarily learns structure/behavior rather than prompt-specific keywords. ​ 🔍  Early evidence: Long CoT has stable “structural fingerprints” We observe a stable behavioral transfer graph: across different strong reasoning models and tasks, the induced distributional characteristics appear highly consistent. ​- In semantic space, we see “linking–folding” patterns: deep reasoning tends to form locally dense structures; self-reflection tends to create backward links for validation/correction; and exploration tends to form weaker cross-cluster connections. ​ 💡 Core hypothesis: effective Long CoT as a “molecular structure” High-quality Long CoT is not merely a linear chain; it is stabilized by three interaction types—analogous to chemical bonds—that organize and constrain reasoning trajectories: ​- Deep Reasoning (covalent-bond-like): forms the main reasoning backbone; if it breaks, the solution collapses. ​- Self-Reflection (hydrogen-bond-like): folds later steps back to earlier ones to verify assumptions, detect errors, and correct the path. ​- Self-Exploration (van der Waals-like): weak but important cross-domain probing that broadens coverage and discovers alternative routes. ​ An additional observation is that the Gibbs–Boltzmann energy formulation is closely aligned with the attention formulation; hence, the “energy distributions” of different bonds can be estimated directly from attention, exhibiting a stable ordering reminiscent of real chemical bond energies. ​ 🍎 “Semantic isomers” of Long CoT For the same problem, trajectories can be semantically close yet differ in the distribution and transitions of bonds, yielding distinct “isomers” with dramatically different trainability and downstream performance. ​- Two isomers that appear similar may still be incompatible: mixing them during training can trigger structural conflicts and degrade performance. ​- ICL is not inherently ineffective; it helps when demonstrations are selected such that their structural distribution aligns with the target high-quality isomer. ​ 🔧 Solution: MOLE-SYN We propose MOLE-SYN: first estimate a behavioral transfer graph from a strong reasoning model, then use it to guide a pure instruct LLM to synthesize Long CoT trajectories. ​- Empirically, distilling Qwen-2.5 with MOLE-SYN–generated trajectories can approach the effectiveness of distillation from QwQ. ​- This initialization also exhibits strong RL potential: it yields more stable RL training curves and sustained improvement headroom. Finally, different behaviors have distinct global effects: deep reasoning makes the core logic more compact, self-reflection increases overall “folding” tightness, and self-exploration expands the reachable search space. ​ 👀 A practical implication is that when CoT is heavily summarized or compressed, the “molecular structure” distribution can be destroyed, and distilled models may underperform even the original teacher. ​ If a prior viewpoint treated CoT behaviors as nodes, this work reframes them as edges that link logical states: the training target may not be “longer answers,” but a more stable reasoning skeleton controlled by structured reasoning behaviors. ​",

We compare five popular alignment objectives and various adaptation strategies from source to target, including target-domain supervised fine-tuning and pseudo-labeling, across summarization and question-answering helpfulness tasks. We found: The adaptation strategy is more influential than the alignment objective. We identify that synthetic supervision is a double-edged sword. While pseudo-labeling yields the highest target-domain win rates, it induces severe mode collapse. This diversity tax results in models that are highly reliable but linguistically monotonous, mirroring the latent templates of the teacher model. Our findings suggest a deployment recommendation: use pseudo-labeling for high-stakes and constrained tasks where reliability is paramount, but favor mixed-domain SFT and online RL for applications requiring creative or varied linguistic expression.",

To make long-horizon rollouts practical, we add segment optical caching, splitting history into hashable segments and caching the visuals, so agents avoid redundant re-rendering as trajectories grow.  We go beyond fixed compression with agentic self-compression: the agent actively emits a compression rate and is trained with a compression-aware reward to balance task success against token efficiency. Across ALFWorld and search-based QA, AgentOCR keeps >95% of text-agent performance while cutting token use by >50% average and ~80% in peak, and our analysis shows up to a 20× rendering speedup thanks to our segment optical caching",

      "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have been widely applied across various domains of finance. Since their training data are largely derived from human-authored corpora, LLMs may inherit a range of human biases. Behavioral biases can lead to instability and uncertainty in decision-making, particularly when processing financial information. However, existing research on LLM bias has mainly focused on direct questioning or simplified, general-purpose settings, with limited consideration of the complex real-world financial environments and high-risk, context-sensitive, multilingual financial misinformation detection tasks (MFMD). In this work, we propose MFMD-Scen, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating behavioral biases of LLMs in MFMD across diverse economic scenarios. In collaboration with financial experts, we construct three types of complex financial scenarios: (i) role- and personality-based, (ii) role- and region-based, and (iii) role-based scenarios incorporating ethnicity and religious beliefs. We further develop a multilingual financial misinformation dataset covering English, Chinese, Greek, and Bengali. By integrating these scenarios with misinformation claims, MFMD-Scen enables a systematic evaluation of 22 mainstream LLMs. Our findings reveal that pronounced behavioral biases persist across both commercial and open-source models.",

      "abstract": "Some of the observations founded are :- i. Dual Level Credit Assessment This mechanism provides a comprehensive evaluation of query quality through both rule-based and model-based assessments. It allows for fine-grained supervision, helping to identify not just redundancy but also the usefulness of each query in the context of the search process. ii. Process Reward Mechanism The introduction of process rewards as a guiding signal for training search agents is a novel approach. It shifts the focus from solely final outcomes to the quality of intermediate queries, addressing a significant gap in existing methods that often overlook this aspect. iii. Query Refinement Strategy The framework employs a systematic query refinement process that identifies low quality queries and generates improved versions. This iterative refinement enhances the effectiveness of search trajectories, allowing agents to adaptively improve their queries based on feedback. iv. Three Stage Curriculum Learning Framework SmartSearch introduces a structured curriculum learning approach that progresses from imitation to alignment and finally to generalization. This staged learning process enables search agents to internalize query quality improvement progressively, enhancing their overall performance. v. Empirical Validation Across Diverse Benchmarks The paper presents extensive experimental results demonstrating SmartSearch's superior performance across multiple challenging knowledge-intensive tasks and web exploration scenarios. This empirical validation highlights the framework's robustness and effectiveness in real-world applications, showcasing its potential impact on future research in search agents and information retrieval.",

      "abstract": "Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has become a prominent paradigm for scaling Large Language Models (LLMs). Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), such as LoRA, is widely adopted to adapt pretrained MoE LLMs to downstream tasks. However, existing approaches assign identical LoRA ranks to all experts, overlooking the intrinsic functional specialization within MoE LLMs. This uniform allocation leads to resource mismatch, task-relevant experts are under-provisioned while less relevant ones receive redundant parameters. We propose a Dynamic Rank LoRA framework named DR-LoRA, which dynamically grows expert LoRA ranks during fine-tuning based on task-specific demands. DR-LoRA employs an Expert Saliency Scoring mechanism that integrates expert routing frequency and LoRA rank importance to quantify each expert's demand for additional capacity. Experts with higher saliency scores are prioritized for rank expansion, enabling the automatic formation of a heterogeneous rank distribution tailored to the target task. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that DR-LoRA consistently outperforms standard LoRA and static allocation strategies under the same parameter budget, achieving superior task performance with more efficient parameter utilization.",

      "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as intelligent agents that reason, plan, and interact with their environments. To effectively scale to long-horizon scenarios, a key capability for such agents is a memory mechanism that can retain, organize, and retrieve past experiences to support downstream decision-making. However, most existing approaches organize and store memories in a flat manner and rely on simple similarity-based retrieval techniques. Even when structured memory is introduced, existing methods often struggle to explicitly capture the logical relationships among experiences or memory units. Moreover, memory access is largely detached from the constructed structure and still depends on shallow semantic retrieval, preventing agents from reasoning logically over long-horizon dependencies. In this work, we propose CompassMem, an event-centric memory framework inspired by Event Segmentation Theory. CompassMem organizes memory as an Event Graph by incrementally segmenting experiences into events and linking them through explicit logical relations. This graph serves as a logic map, enabling agents to perform structured and goal-directed navigation over memory beyond superficial retrieval, progressively gathering valuable memories to support long-horizon reasoning. Experiments on LoCoMo and NarrativeQA demonstrate that CompassMem consistently improves both retrieval and reasoning performance across multiple backbone models.",

      "abstract": "Real-time multimodal auto-completion is essential for digital assistants, chatbots, design tools, and healthcare consultations, where user inputs rely on shared visual context. We introduce Multimodal Auto-Completion (MAC), a task that predicts upcoming characters in live chats using partially typed text and visual cues. Unlike traditional text-only auto-completion (TAC), MAC grounds predictions in multimodal context to better capture user intent. To enable this task, we adapt MMDialog and ImageChat to create benchmark datasets. We evaluate leading vision-language models (VLMs) against strong textual baselines, highlighting trade-offs in accuracy and efficiency. We present Router-Suggest, a router framework that dynamically selects between textual models and VLMs based on dialog context, along with a lightweight variant for resource-constrained environments. Router-Suggest achieves a 2.3x to 10x speedup over the best-performing VLM. A user study shows that VLMs significantly excel over textual models on user satisfaction, notably saving user typing effort and improving the quality of completions in multi-turn conversations. These findings underscore the need for multimodal context in auto-completions, leading to smarter, user-aware assistants.",

      "title": "The Persona Paradox: Medical Personas as Behavioral Priors in Clinical Language Models",
      "abstract": "This paper investigates how \"persona conditioning\" (e.g., instructing an LLM to act as a specific medical professional) impacts clinical decision-making. The authors challenge the assumption that assigning a medical persona consistently improves accuracy or safety, labeling this inconsistency the \"Persona Paradox.\" Key Insights: Non-Monotonic Effects: Assigning a medical persona (like an Emergency Department physician) does not always improve performance. It acts as a behavioral prior that can help in some contexts but hurt in others. The Context Gap: Medical personas improved accuracy and calibration by up to 20% in critical-care tasks (triage) but degraded performance by a similar margin in primary-care settings. Interaction Styles: Adding styles such as \"bold\" or \"cautious\" changes the model’s risk propensity, but these effects vary widely across base models. The Alignment Gap: While \"LLM judges\" preferred medical personas for safety-critical cases, human clinicians were much more skeptical. Human experts showed low confidence in the AI's reasoning quality in 95.9% of cases, despite moderate agreement on safety compliance. Conclusion The study concludes that personas are not \"expertise switches\" but rather priors that introduce context-dependent trade-offs. Relying on personas for clinical safety is risky because they do not provide a universal guarantee of better judgment. Personas should be used with caution in high-stakes medicine, as they can inadvertently trigger biases or performance drops depending on the specific clinical task.",
