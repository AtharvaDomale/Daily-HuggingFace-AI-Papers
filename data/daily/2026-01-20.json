      "abstract": "This paper fundamentally shows that: \"The commonly used group-relative advantage estimator is inherently biased except at p_t = 0.5: it systematically underestimates true advantage on hard prompts and overestimates true advantag on easy prompts\". This bias is not just random—it becomes deterministic in extreme difficulty regimes, meaning the estimator must underestimate for very hard prompts and must overestimate for very easy prompts. This analysis highlights this as a core limitation in group-relative methods and motivates corrections that better align estimated and true advantage.",

The technology is never used. But the strategic shift is complete: the manipulator secures a higher payoff, while other players are left worse off. In our new paper, \"The Poisoned Apple Effect\", we identify a strategic vulnerability in AI-mediated markets. We show how agents can expand the technological space purely to manipulate the mediator's design. The result? The manipulator profits from the new rules, while competitors (and social welfare) pay the price.",

      "abstract": "💡 Overview Personalization is increasingly adopted in modern LLM systems, but we find it can systematically distort factual reasoning. We identify personalization-induced hallucinations, where models generate answers aligned with user history rather than objective truth. To mitigate this, we also propose Factuality-Preserving Personalized Steering (FPPS), a lightweight inference-time approach that detects harmful personalization and adaptively steers internal representations to recover factual correctness while keeping useful personalization. 🔥Key Insights Problem discovery: We provide the first systematic study of personalization-induced hallucinations and show risks to factual reliability, downstream knowledge acquisition, and long-term user trust. Mitigation method: We propose FPPS, a lightweight inference-time framework that selectively restores factuality under personalization. Evaluation dataset: We develop PFQABench to jointly evaluate factual QA and personalized QA under aligned user sessions, enabling controlled assessment of factuality failures and mitigation. Results: Extensive experiments across multiple LLM backbones and personalization methods show FPPS substantially improves factual accuracy without sacrificing personalization performance.",

      "abstract": "abs: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as essential generalist robot policies for diverse manipulation tasks, conventionally relying on directly translating multimodal inputs into actions via Vision-Language Model (VLM) embeddings. Recent advancements have introduced explicit intermediary reasoning, such as sub-task prediction (language) or goal image synthesis (vision), to guide action generation. However, these intermediate reasoning are often indirect and inherently limited in their capacity to convey the full, granular information required for precise action execution. Instead, we posit that the most effective form of reasoning is one that deliberates directly in the action space. We introduce Action Chain-of-Thought (ACoT), a paradigm where the reasoning process itself is formulated as a structured sequence of coarse action intents that guide the final policy. In this paper, we propose ACoT-VLA, a novel architecture that materializes the ACoT paradigm. Specifically, we introduce two complementary components: an Explicit Action Reasoner (EAR) and Implicit Action Reasoner (IAR). The former proposes coarse reference trajectories as explicit action-level reasoning steps, while the latter extracts latent action priors from internal representations of multimodal input, co-forming an ACoT that conditions the downstream action head to enable grounded policy learning. Extensive experiments in real-world and simulation environments demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method, which achieves 98.5%, 84.1%, and 47.4% on LIBERO, LIBERO-Plus and VLABench, respectively.",

      "abstract": "Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is a fundamental post-training strategy to align Large Language Models (LLMs) with human intent. However, traditional SFT often ignores the one-to-many nature of language by forcing alignment with a single reference answer, leading to the model overfitting to non-core expressions. Although our empirical analysis suggests that introducing multiple reference answers can mitigate this issue, the prohibitive data and computational costs necessitate a strategic shift: prioritizing the mitigation of single-reference overfitting over the costly pursuit of answer diversity. To achieve this, we reveal the intrinsic connection between token probability and semantic importance: high-probability tokens carry the core logical framework, while low-probability tokens are mostly replaceable expressions. Based on this insight, we propose ProFit, which selectively masks low-probability tokens to prevent surface-level overfitting. Extensive experiments confirm that ProFit consistently outperforms traditional SFT baselines on general reasoning and mathematical benchmarks.

      "abstract": "Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, yet their proficiency in understanding and reasoning over multiple images remains largely unexplored. While existing benchmarks have initiated the evaluation of multi-image models, a comprehensive analysis of their core weaknesses and their causes is still lacking. In this work, we introduce MIMIC (Multi-Image Model Insights and Challenges), a new benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate the multi-image capabilities of LVLMs. Using MIMIC, we conduct a series of diagnostic experiments that reveal pervasive issues: LVLMs often fail to aggregate information across images and struggle to track or attend to multiple concepts simultaneously. To address these failures, we propose two novel complementary remedies. On the data side, we present a procedural data-generation strategy that composes single-image annotations into rich, targeted multi-image training examples. On the optimization side, we analyze layer-wise attention patterns and derive an attention-masking scheme tailored for multi-image inputs. Experiments substantially improved cross-image aggregation, while also enhancing performance on existing multi-image benchmarks, outperforming prior state of the art across tasks. Data and code will be made available at https://github.com/anurag-198/MIMIC .",

      "abstract": "Some of the observations founded are : i. Difficulty based example selection is the dominant driver of performance: Selecting challenging but learnable examples yields the largest gains in multimodal reasoning accuracy, outperforming other curation strategies. ii. Increasing dataset size does not reliably improve mean accuracy: Once a well aligned base dataset is chosen, larger datasets mainly reduce run to run variance rather than boosting average performance. iii. Data curation operates in a saturation regime: Most performance improvements come from a relatively small number of carefully curated examples, with diminishing returns from adding more data. iv. Common diversity heuristics provide little or no benefit: Techniques such as clustering based diversity, category balancing, and synthetic augmentation often fail to improve performance and can even degrade accuracy. v. Alignment between dataset, benchmark, and base model is crucial: Strong alignment amplifies the effectiveness of difficulty filtering and explains why compact, well aligned datasets can outperform larger but less aligned ones.",

      "abstract": "Recent diffusion-based video generation models can synthesize visually plausible videos, yet they often struggle to satisfy physical constraints. A key reason is that most existing approaches remain single-stage: they entangle high-level physical understanding with low-level visual synthesis, making it hard to generate content that require explicit physical reasoning. To address this limitation, we propose a training-free three-stage pipeline, PhyRPR: PhyReason–PhyPlan–PhyRefine, which decouples physical understanding from visual synthesis. Specifically, PhyReason uses a large multimodal model for physical state reasoning and an image generator for keyframe synthesis; PhyPlan deterministically synthesizes a controllable coarse motion scaffold; and PhyRefine injects this scaffold into diffusion sampling via a latent fusion strategy to refine appearance while preserving the planned dynamics. This staged design enables explicit physical control during generation. Extensive experiments under physics constraints show that our method consistently improves physical plausibility and motion controllability.",
